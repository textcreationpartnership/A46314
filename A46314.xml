            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>A JOURNAL OF THE War with <hi>Holland,</hi> From His Majeſties departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> until his return.</head>
                  <head type="sub">According to the order of Action and Time.</head>
                  <p>THE States of Holland were raiſed in a ſhort time to ſuch a pitch of Pride and Inſolence, that 'twas impoſſible they ſhould maintain it long. Their Irreligion was ſo great, that Heaven could no more be deaf to the juſt complaints of the Oppreſſed. They were ſo blind, as to take no notice of the Favors of that Monarch, who had, as it were, raiſed them out of nothing: and they pretended to give Law to thoſe Powers,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63600:14"/>from whom, not long before, they had had petition'd to receive it. In fine, their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, their Tyranny, and their Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude did exceed all bounds: and they were ſo puft up with the thoughts of being Princes, and underſtood withal ſo little what Soveraignty was, that they imagined all the World ought to ſtoop and pay Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them.</p>
                  <p>There was then a neceſſity that ſome one or other ſhould charitably interpoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſe them; and none could undertake that Work more effectually, then our Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. That care was his particular concern, and none had ſo great an Intereſt in it as Himſelf. He had the Power, and nothing was wanting but a Will; which he is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to exert, whenſoever ſo juſt an occaſion offers it ſelf. As being <hi>The moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> He was obliged to undertake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Church: as one that had raiſed them, 'twas His Intereſt to chaſtiſe their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as being the moſt abſolute Monarch in the World, it became His glory to maintain His Soveraignty. 'Twas this that obliged Him to declare War, and to put Himſelf at the head of a Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, to teach them ſuch Leſſons, as they ſhould never forget.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty parted from S. <hi>Germains,</hi> on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63600:14"/>Thurſday the 28. of April, in the Year 1672, and having taken the way of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> He arrived at <hi>Rocroy</hi> the ſecond of May en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, where the Troops, that were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Army, began to <hi>rendevouz;</hi> as thoſe, which were to make an Army for Monſieur the Prince, did at <hi>Sedan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame day we came alſo to <hi>Rocroy,</hi> by the way of <hi>Fymes, Rheimes,</hi> and <hi>Retel.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The twelfth in the morning, Monſieur the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi> returned from <hi>Leige,</hi> and we being joyned with the Army of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Turenne,</hi> went to encamp at <hi>Greville</hi> near <hi>Tongren,</hi> which we took without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and placed a Garriſon in it. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Count <hi>de Chamilly,</hi> came to us from

                     <hi>Huy,</hi> where he had bin before.</p>
                  <p>The thirteenth, Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Greville,</hi> but he ſent away the Foot Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Alſace</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> that made ſix Bodies, three Companies of Dragoons of the Regiment <hi>Royall,</hi> that came to 300 men, the Horſe Regiments <hi>de Joyeuſe, de Tury, de Gaſſion, de S.

                  </p>
                  <p>The fourteenth, we went and encamped at <hi>Rakem,</hi> which lies two Leagues on the other ſide of <hi>Maeſtrickt,</hi> and within one of <hi>Maeſiick.</hi> M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> followed us with his Army; and the King marched another way near <hi>Vizè,</hi> 2 Leagues above <hi>Maeſtricht.</hi> The 15. in the morning, we came up within ſight of <hi>Maiſiich,</hi> where the army being drawn up, M. the Count <hi>de Chamilly</hi> ſummon'd the Town, which not ſeeming averſe to a Parley, he went in, but they not agreeing upon Conditions, command was given to prepare Faggots, and we began to raiſe a Battery for four pieces of Canon; and not ſtaying to throw up Trenches, ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Foot were drawn out, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come up under the ſhelter of ſome thick Hedges, and old Walls which lay near the Town-ditch. All this was done by two in the Afternoon, and then we began
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63600:17"/>to play upon the Town, which did the like upon us. They held out about five hours, and defended themſelves well enough. In this Action we loſt in all but one or two Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and ſome few common Soldiers, and the Enemy had not above 3 or 4 men killed: but notwithſtanding, about 7 of the Clock they beat a Parley, and denr'd to Treat; whereupon the Count <hi>de Chamilly,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Ranes</hi> went in again, and came not back till the Town was ſurrendred; and in the mean time, the Chevalier <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> Camp Marſhal to the Army, commanded the Attaque.</p>
                  <p>But before this, not imagining the Place would, have yielded ſo ſoon, advice was given thereof to Mareſhal <hi>Turenne,</hi> who thereupon advanced, and was very near when the Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> took Horſe and left the Town, which had juſt now yielded, to advertiſe him of it. Whereupon he made a halt, and encamp'd with his Army pretty near ours, and himſelf retir'd into one of the M. <hi>de Ranes</hi>'s Houſes, who went back imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly into the Town to Count <hi>de Chamilly</hi> and thence they both return'd to <hi>Marſha Turenne.</hi> This Action gave occaſion to ſome Dutch Railery, who thereupon told that the French had taken <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> no no, I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take would they ſay, 'tis <hi>Maeſiick:</hi> but this was the laſt time they were in a ralling hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63600:17"/>for ſince then we have dealt with them in ſuch earneſt, that they have not had time to bethink themſelves, or give their minds to ſo much relaxation, as to be in a fit of drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or playing the <hi>Satyriſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſixteenth, we left the <hi>Sieur Chamilly</hi> at <hi>Maeſiick</hi> with his Troops, and Monſieur <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> to ſee to the fortifying of the Place. The Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> coaſted along the River towards <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> with three Companies of Dragoons, and took all the Boats he met with, to the number of 25, and had them all brought back up the River to the Abby of <hi>Ocq,</hi> where we were by that time encamped, and where at our coming we found Monſieur <hi>Vaubrun</hi> Camp Marſhal, with a part of the Army which he there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p>The 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> in the Morning, we left that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the conduct of Monſieur <hi>Vaubrun</hi> their Commander, and march'd with ſome Guides to <hi>Vizè,</hi> whether His Majeſty came alſo the ſame day; but in our March, coming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Canon ſhot of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> there iſſued out thence ſome Horſe, one part of which ſeem'd to turn off towards Monſieur <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun</hi>'s Camp, and the other to advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. The <hi>Sieurs T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63600:18"/>Shot at us, which did no harm. A League from thence, we met the Count <hi>de Lorge</hi> with his flying Army, who had encamp'd hard by, upon the way to <hi>Tongres:</hi> He drew near likewiſe to <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and beſet it cloſely on his ſide, as Monſieur <hi>de Vaubrun</hi> had on the other.</p>
                  <p>The 18. the King went to take a view of the out-works of the <hi>Fort ...</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> belongs to the Spaniard, and lies on the right from the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> near a League from <hi>Vizè,</hi> and two from <hi>Maeſtricht:</hi> he was ſaluted by the Garriſon, which is always very ſtrong, with many great Guns, and volleys of ſmall ſhot,</p>
                  <p>The 19. Monſieur the Prince encamped within two Leagues of us, and came the ſame day with Monſieur the Duke, to viſit the King; and afterwards (having firſt been at Council) return'd to his Camp.</p>
                  <p>The 20. the Kings Army, as alſo that of the Prince, reſted.</p>
                  <p>The 21. They reſted again, and a Bridge of Boats was begun upon the <hi>Meuſe</hi> below <hi>Vizè.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Vaubrun</hi> went and joyned his Troops to thoſe of Monſieur <hi>de Chamilly,</hi> who have ſince been employ'd, almoſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the reſt of the Campaigne, in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>Maſeick,</hi> and in courſing about <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht.</hi>

                  <p>The 22. they continued working about the Bridge, which was well forwarded. The ſame day the Prince's Army march'd.</p>
                  <p>The twenty third, His Majeſty reſted again, the Bridge was finiſh'd, and the <hi>Collonel</hi> Regiment of Dragoons left <hi>Vizè</hi> to go and joyn with the Army of Monſieur the Prince, under whom it ſerv'd during the reſt of the Campaigne. Three Companies of the Regiment <hi>Royall,</hi> which had been left about <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> came back. The heavy bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage paſt the River all that day. In the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening ſome were drawn out of the Kings <hi>Houſhold</hi> to go and get Intelligence of the Enemy toward <hi>Maeſtricht:</hi> it fell to the lot of the Marquis of <hi>Saurebeuf,</hi> a younger Brother, one of the Kings Guards, to be firſt pick'd out to go, and ſee what might be diſcover'd at the Palliſado. He brought back word to the Brigadier of Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers who commanded the Party, that he had ſeen a Sentinel without the Palliſado, and within many lighted matches, which made him think it was well man'd. The Commander not being ſatisfied with this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, told him, That would not ſerve his turn, and that the King would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any body had gone out of the place or no, wherefore he muſt return and do his utmoſt to learn that; which he preſently did, and going ſtreight to the Sentinel, ask'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63600:19"/>him, If the Party that went out that day, were yet return'd; to which, he receiv'd no other anſwer then a Musket-ſhot in his throat, that was followed by at leaſt forty more, which however miſt him; but the firſt wound was in ſo dangerous a place, that he immediatly fell, and was altogether una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make his Eſcape; ſo that the Enemies carryed him into the Town, where he was long kept Priſoner and ill of his wound.</p>
                  <p>The 24. His Majeſty paſs'd the <hi>Maes</hi> upon the bridge of Boats, with the whole Army, except only Five hundred Foot, which were drawn out by lot to be left in Garriſon at <hi>Vizè,</hi> a little Town lying on the right ſide of the <hi>Maes,</hi> between <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> and <hi>Liege;</hi> ſo we went and encamp'd at <hi>Biernaw</hi> upon the little River <hi>Berwine,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Limbourg.</hi> The ſame day in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Monſieur the Vicount of <hi>Turenne,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Ranes,</hi> march'd with ſome Horſe and Dragoons to the Fort call'd <hi>Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quemont,</hi> (otherwiſe <hi>Fauquenton,</hi> or <hi>Valkem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borg.</hi>) This is a Caſtle three hours Journey from <hi>Macſtricht,</hi> on the other ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, built on a ſteep Rock; at the Foot of which there is a great Town, bearing the ſame name, and depending on it. There was in it a Garriſon for the Hollander, but upon notice of the march of the foreſaid
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63600:19"/>Perſons, they retir'd into <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and quitted the Caſtle, though it be inacceſſible and impregnable without Canon. There are within it Caves of a Prodigious depth and bigneſs, wherein a whole Army might be hid: there was little Proviſion in it, for which reaſon the Sieur <hi>de la Roüillardiere,</hi> Captain of a Company of Dragoons, who was left there with One hundred men, was forc'd to buy ſome from the Town, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neighboring places; the King having ordered, That he ſhould take nothing but what was paid for.</p>
                  <p>The 25. His Majeſty reſted.</p>
                  <p>The 26. the Kings Army ſtill reſted, and nothing extraordinary paſſed. Monſieur the Prince ſtill march'd forward toward the <hi>Rhine,</hi> upon the reſolution which had been taken not to ſet upon <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> but to go ſtraight on and take the places which lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long that River, and ſo drive ſtraight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into Holland.</p>
                  <p>The 27. at night, the Weather grew very bad, and in the morning it was very cloudy and louring, but we departed notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and came to <hi>Willers,</hi> where the Rain did not a little incommode us.</p>
                  <p>The 28. The Weather being good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the King went and encamp'd at <hi>Rolduc,</hi> and upon ſome Intelligence, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

                  </p>
                  <p>The 29. the King came within half a League of <hi>Juliers,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> encamp'd at <hi>Telns,</hi> a little Village between <hi>Nuis</hi> and <hi>Keiſerwort,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi> The ſame day the Prince's Army paſs'd the <hi>Rhine</hi> upon a certain Float of Wood, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> carryed 2000 Foot and 200 Horſe, with all their baggage at a time: and his Highneſs and the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> treated them ſo well at their arrival at <hi>Keiſerwort,</hi> that they were all very merry, which yet hinder'd not the Duke of <hi>Newbourg</hi> from coming in the Evening to ſee Monſieur de <hi>Turenne,</hi> and to invite him to Dinner the next day.</p>
                  <p>The 30. We ſtayed at <hi>Telns.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> dined with the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> and in the Evening at his return he had 96 Priſoners brought him, ſent by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Montal,</hi> Governor of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> who commanding a Party of our Troops, had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63600:20"/>fallen into an Ambuſh of theirs, and with five or ſix more had born up againſt all their Firing, amongſt whom <hi>Monſieur the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier de Marſillac</hi> was mortally wounded. In the mean time, forty Dragoons lighted off their Horſes, and with 30 Muſqueteers, did ſo beſtir themſelves, that before the Enemy could make a ſecond diſcharge, they had quite routed them, kill'd eleven, and took their Commander (who defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo manfully, that they were forced to uſe him worſe then they deſir'd) with all the reſt, excepting 2 or 3 who at firſt betook themſelves to their heels. Afterwards, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain being known by ſome of the Officers of our Party, had quarter given him; &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet dead, all poſſible means were us'd to ſave his Life. He was carryed off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Caſtle, where Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſent him his own Chirurgion, but to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for he dyed ſoon after. The reſt of the Priſoners were brought to <hi>Nuis,</hi> where Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Strasbourg</hi> arriv'd the ſame day, and was ſaluted with the great Guns of the Town.</p>
                  <p>The 31. in the Morning, Monſieur <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> took with him a party of the <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> all the Light Guards of the Kings Houſhold, three Companies of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Royall</hi> of Dragoons, a part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63600:21"/>of the French Guards, and ſome Light Horſe; who, after having winter'd in the Country of <hi>Colen,</hi> came by order of His Majeſty to encamp and intrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> on the left ſide near <hi>Keiſerwort,</hi> where they encamped &amp; fortified themſelves very commodiouſly. Afterwards we march'd all day, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd under a great Hill above <hi>Orſoy.</hi> The King march'd on to <hi>Nuys,</hi> and Monſieur the Prince advanc'd by the ſide of him in equal marches.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of <hi>June,</hi> the King left <hi>Nuys</hi> and beſieg'd <hi>Orſoy,</hi> a little Town of a reaſonable ſtrength, ſituate on the left ſide of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> As ſoon as His Majeſty came before it, He caus'd it to be ſummon'd, but the Governor refuſing to yield it up, we were immediatly employ'd about making of Faggots, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves into a condition to attaque it.</p>
                  <p>The next day Monſieur the Prince came before <hi>Wezel,</hi> and did that day only encamp and inveſt the Town, which ſeem'd ſtrong and conſiderable enough to make us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed cautiouſly in our attaque. <hi>Wezel</hi> is a very great Town, ſituate on the right ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> at the Mouth of the River <hi>Lyppe.</hi> It hath a great Ditch fac'd with good brick, and is divided in the middle by a great Trench, and very good Fortifications, ſo that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63600:21"/>if one half of the Town were gain'd, one ſhould be put to the trouble of a Siege to get the other. Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> with whom we were, came before <hi>Burick,</hi> which we inveſted; and after the Camp was ſetled, he ſent for ſome Foot to raiſe a Redout between this Town and <hi>Wezel,</hi> which are over-againſt one the other, on each ſide the <hi>Rhine. Burick</hi> is two good Musket-ſhot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from it, but not ſo far, but that they might give one another mutual aſſiſtance. For this reaſon it was thought neceſſary to make this Redout, as well to hinder their communication, as to cut off the Paſſage between <hi>Burick</hi> and the River, from whence the Enemy might have miſchiev'd us in the Trenches, which we were about to begin on the other ſide, ſo to make our approaches to <hi>Wezel.</hi> At the ſame time we were employ'd in raiſing a Battery on the bank of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to hinder the Dutch Veſſels going to and fro upon the River, and aſſiſting the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd. At our firſt coming thither we took two of them, which we mann'd with Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and plac'd in the middle of the River. The Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the French Troops belonging to the Biſhops of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> beſieg'd <hi>Lokem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:63600:22"/>
                  <p>The ſecond, the King commanded an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault to be given to <hi>Orſoy,</hi> whereupon we preſently made our ſelves Maſters of the Counterſcarpe, and gain'd all the out-works, which made the Governor deſire to come to compoſition; but no other Articles being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, but, That the Garriſon ſhould ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves upon diſcretion, He would not hear of that: ſo the King ſent him back, threatning, That if they diſcharg'd but one Canon more, He would have no mercy on them. But this hinder'd not their firing much more freely then they had don before, which greatly incens'd the King. Monſieur the Prince caus'd the Fort of <hi>Lippe</hi> to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued that Evening, which was carryed by the Count <hi>de Nogent</hi> by Aſſault. This very much terrified thoſe of <hi>Wezel,</hi> becauſe that Fort was near, and did in ſome manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the place. The Governor was there kill'd, with his Pike in his hand.</p>
                  <p>In Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Army, they were all buſied in making their Lines of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation, and blocking up the Town. The Battery, begun the day before upon the bank of the River, was finiſh'd, and nine pieces of Ordnance mounted on it. Monſieur the Prince raiſed alſo another on his ſide of the River, conſiſting of 6 Pieces; and in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening we were buſied in repairing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doute,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63600:22"/>which had been almoſt beat down that day by the Guns of the two Towns.</p>
                  <p>The third, <hi>Orſoy</hi> yielded. For the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſeeing himſelf unable to make any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſiſtance, was fled with his Family, and all that was moſt dear to him, in a ſmall Veſſel, deſigning to gain <hi>Rhineberg;</hi> but His Majeſty having intelligence of it, and being incens'd againſt him for his ſtubbornneſs, caus'd the Canon to play ſo hard upon him, that at laſt, ſeeing one of his Wives Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cut off in the middle by a Canon ſhot, he was forc'd to come aſhore, and yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to the mercy of the Conquerors. The Plunder of the Caſtle was given to the Soldiery, and the Garriſon made Priſoners at diſcretion. The chief Perſons whom we loſt in the Action, were the <hi>Sieur de Valens,</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>D'Arquien,</hi> which laſt was kill'd by a Canon-ſhot near the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who preſently afterwards commanded <hi>Rhineburg</hi> to be inveſted. At the Prince's Army, the whole day was ſpent in parlying, for the Inhabitants would by no means hear of ſtanding it out; and the Garriſon, tho finding themſelves ſo weak as not to be able to undertake any thing, could not reſolve to yield themſelves upon diſcretion, ſo that the whole day paſs'd without any Action. As for us who were before <hi>Burick,</hi> we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63600:23"/>our ſelves to attaque it ſo vigorouſly, as not be behind-hand with the other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. We made Faggots, and in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon carryed them almoſt as far as the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſado's, not without the loſs of ſome Troopers and their Horſes, as well there as in our Camp, which lay level with the Canon of the Town. In the Evening, that part of the Regiment of the Kings Guards which was in our Army, and the Regiments of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> opened their Trenches. The Marquis <hi>de Ranes,</hi> with 150 Dragoons which he commanded, was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque a Half-moon, and intending to make his way forwards, reſolved himſelf to be at the head of them. A like number were drawn out of the Regiments of <hi>Caſtelneau</hi> and <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> to do as much on the other ſide; which returning all ſafe, could not properly be ſaid to have gone upon the Forlorn. But juſt as we were about to fall on, we heard a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet from the Town, and aſſoon as we had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it an Officer came forth, &amp; after him a ſecond, ſo that the Soldiers of the Guards, without ſtaying for the iſſue of the deſign'd Conference, began to cry, That they might leave off working at their Trenches, ſeeing the Enemy yielded, and deſired quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But the laſt Officer ſeeming a little
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63600:23"/>more fierce and reſolute then the other, becauſe he had not a ready anſwer; we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to fall on immediatly if they did not yield without delay; which the Enemy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and having diſcover'd ſome Scaling-ladders juſt ready to be made uſe of, they open'd their Gates, and the Regiment of Guards enter'd the Town juſt about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and feaſted themſelves with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which they found were bringing to the Soldiers that were upon Service in the Out-works. All the Garriſon were made Priſoners at diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Burick</hi> is a reaſonable great Town, ſituate upon the left Bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> within two Muſquet-ſhot of the River, in a fine even fertile Soil. The ſpace that is between it and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> is a great Marſh, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Fields and Meadows, which are nothing near ſo boggy and wet, as the moſt part of the reſt of <hi>Holland, Zeland</hi> and <hi>Frizeland.</hi> It lies over-againſt <hi>Wezel</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which is a very fair great Town. <hi>Burick</hi> is none of the leaſt Towns which the Dutch have in theſe parts; its Fortifications are good, and it hath good Baſtions and Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moons, almoſt wholly of earth, but their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works are too big. The C. <hi>de Chamilly</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Town, ſaid, It might well have held out 3 Months: From whence 'tis plain,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63600:24"/>that in the confidence of its ſtrength the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers had been negligent: and not having taken care to keep their Fortifications in good repair, we found them laboring day and night in making Gabions for the top of the Ramparts; but they were ſo ſuddenly and briskly ſet upon, that they could by no means perfect them. The ſame day we took two Barques upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and by that means we doubled the Guard we had plac'd in the middle of it. As ſoon as <hi>Burick</hi> was yielded, M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> receiv'd a Pacquet from the King, upon which he immediatly haſtned to wait on His Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, nothing was done at the Kings Army, nor at Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi>'s; but at the Princes they open'd Trenches before <hi>Wezel,</hi> which would not yield up to mercy. They were begun on the ſide of the Town that lies toward the River, and a Drain was made to empty the Ditch, which would have been done the night following, had not the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at laſt, ſeeing his Highneſs reſolv'd to ſet on then vigorouſly, ſent the Keys of the Town, and yielded themſelves up to mercy. At the ſame time we were inform'd, that the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> had taken <hi>Lokem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifth, the Kings Army was buſied in making Faggots and Gabions for the attaqu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Rhineberg.</hi> His Majeſty ſent a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63600:24"/>to M. <hi>de Ranes</hi> to meet him there with the Regiment Royal of Dragoons, which was then with him before <hi>Burick,</hi> which he did. M. the Prince at 6 in the Morning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Wezel,</hi> and viſited the Officers and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Garriſon, where he ſearch'd for French-men, and finding 10 or 11, had them hang'd. The Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> turn'd off toward <hi>Grol,</hi> and M. <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Army reſted. M. <hi>Cajax</hi> was made Governor of <hi>Orſoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fixth in the Morning, 10000 Faggots more were ordered to be made, which the Dragoons perform'd, but the Garriſon at <hi>Rhineberg</hi> finding themſelves too weak to reſiſt a Victorious Royal Army; and being likewiſe out of hope of receiving the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors were promiſed them by the States, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to yield. The Officers of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon came, and laying themſelves at his Feet, begg'd of him not to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to their coſt of the trick which the States had put upon them, in promiſing them 2000 Men more as a reinforcement, which they had not perform'd. His Majeſty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the falſhood of the States Promiſes, even to their own Soldiers, was mov'd to compaſſionate their condition, and thereupon gave them leave to march out, Drums beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Colours flying, with Match lighted, and Bullet in mouth; which they did, and march'd
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63600:25"/>toward <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> the King having given them a Convoy, and Proviſion for four days. The Regiment of <hi>Guards</hi> entred the place about one of the Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rhineberg</hi> is a pretty large Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Colen,</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate on the left ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the midſt of a very low Marſhy Country, which contributes much to its ſtrength. The States had taken it again and again from the Spaniards, they having wrongfully took it from the Elector of <hi>Colen,</hi> who ever ſince hath been demanding it of them, and making complaints upon that account in every Diet; till at length the Spaniard propos'd to give it him back, on condition he might keep a Garriſon there: But this condition not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Elector, they at laſt promis'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſerve, to put it into his hands; but how inſtant ſoever the Elector was with them, he could never perſwade them to be as good as their word: they had ſo many ſhifts, feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned excuſes, and pretences, that at laſt they proved the chief cauſe of the Electors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring War againſt them. Whilſt it was in their poſſeſſion, they fortifyed it to their own minds; and being it was a Frontier Town, they had made it one of their ſtrongeſt Holds. The Fortifications are very regular;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63600:25"/>there are good Baſtions and Half-moons, good Ramparts, and very broad Ditches: but their Out-works are to big, as in moſt of their Towns. All the Works are of Earth, which makes them the eaſier to be aſſaulted, though it better reſiſt the Canon, which can only make a hole in them.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day ſome Foot were ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Rhine</hi> to plunder a certain Caſtle there, but the Prince had ſent ſome others to the ſame purpoſe the day before; ſo that thoſe who came laſt, did but loſe their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. The Princes and Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Armies reſted again, and the Count <hi>d'Eſtrade</hi> was made Governor of <hi>Wezel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeventh, Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> left the King, and ſo did M. <hi>de Ranes,</hi> and the Regiment Royal of Dragoons. We went and joyn'd with the Army which was left before <hi>Burick,</hi> and having ſent all our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt baggage to <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> where we left the new Companies of the Regiment of <hi>Turenne</hi> in garriſon, we went and encamp'd at <hi>Worſtemberg</hi> near <hi>Santein,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Cleve,</hi> which belongs to the Duke of <hi>Brandenbourg.</hi> M. the Prince left <hi>Wezel,</hi> and advanced likewiſe on his ſide. The King's Army ſtayed ſtill at <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> with the <hi>Munſter</hi> forces attaqued <hi>Grol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:63600:26"/>
                  <p>The eighth, the King left <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> &amp; came to <hi>Burick,</hi> whether the Float was brought to waft over the Army to the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> We left <hi>Worſtemberg</hi> in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, paſſed by <hi>Zante</hi> or <hi>Santein,</hi> and went and beſieg'd the Fort of <hi>Rees,</hi> which we preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſet ſo cloſely, that the frighted Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon durſt not fire ſo much as one gun. But the Town which lyes on the other bank of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> was not ſo civil, for their Canon did much harm to our Dragoons, eſpecially thoſe, who being come cloſe up, lay open to them. There were many of them loſt, and more of their horſes. But notwithſtanding the Capitulation went on at the Fort, which was but ill man'd, and becauſe the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſtood upon terms, and would not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the place before he had ſeen and felt our Canon, M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> commanded the Foot to advance and begin the Aſſault, which they did without any reſiſtance from the Enemy (who had retired into a Redout which was very ſtrong.) Wherefore he caus'd a bridge of hurdles to be made, by which he paſs'd over and enter'd the place himſelf, and commanded the Governor and his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to be beſet, who at laſt yeilded. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we turn'd the Canon of this Fort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Town, and much ſhot paſt on both ſides. Many of the Enemies Guns were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63600:26"/>and the whole Town ſo tired out that the next day they were forc'd to carry the Keys of their Gates to M. the Prince, who came up as we did, and made a ſhew as if he would alſo have attaqued it, though his deſign was to go ſtreight on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a party of the Enemies which kept the Paſſage of the Iſle of <hi>Beter</hi> and of the <hi>Yſſel,</hi> that the King might go and beſiege that Town and <hi>Emerick.</hi> As ſoon as the Fort had yeilded, Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> left there a part of his Horſe, all his foot, the Artillery and Baggage; and upon no tice that 4000 of the Enemies Horſe had paſs'd the <hi>Wahal,</hi> with a deſign, as 'twas thought, to ſet upon us, we went to meet them. To that purpoſe we went and paſs'd the River near <hi>Calcar,</hi> a little Town (in the Country of <hi>Cleve</hi>) defended by a Citadel, whoſe fortifications are all of earth without any other facing. We were ſaluted in our paſſage by at leaſt 100 great Guns, and thence paſs'd to <hi>Cleves,</hi> where our Army was victualled <hi>gratis.</hi> It is the capital City of the whole Province, but is a place of no defence. Afterwards we encamped a quarter of an hours riding from that City, by a park, which belongs to a Houſe of pleaſure of the Duke of <hi>Brandebourg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ninth was wholly ſpent in paſſing the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63600:27"/>Kings Army from the left to the right ſide of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The town of <hi>Rees</hi> quite ſpent and wearied out by our Canon from the Fort, brought in her Keys, and yeilded as the reſt had done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rees</hi> is a fair great Town ſituate on the right ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> 3 leagues below <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> and <hi>Wezel,</hi> and 2 leagues above <hi>Emerick.</hi> It is ſtrengthned by a good Fort of its own name, ſeparated from it only by the <hi>Rhine,</hi> whoſe waters on the right ſide waſh the walls of the Town, and on the left thoſe of the Fort. This Town is very great, her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications very compleat and good. It hath good Baſtions, Horn-works, Half-Moons well ſtrengthn'd with good Palliſſados, large ditches, and covered ways, all very regular. In fine, when M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> enter'd the Fort, he told them that were near him, that their friends that knew <hi>Reés,</hi> and heard they laid Siege to it, would certainly be very much concern'd for them: and thereupon having ſent for the ſieur <hi>Paul,</hi> a Flemming Engineer, to ask his opinion of it, he anſwered him, that if any body would have an excellent Model of a regular Fortification, they need not ſeek it any where elſe, but might take it from <hi>Rees</hi> and its Fort; which is a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagone, whoſe outworks were a little out of repair, but within there was a Redout
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63600:27"/>which they call the Caſtle, which is very well and in good caſe. It is ſeparated from the Body of the Fort by a great flat broad ditch, which is deeper then it is broad, over which there is a little Draw-bridge, and a good Gate on the other ſide, and a high ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part well palliſſado'd and Gabioon'd, which at each corner hath two little Horn-works, which flank upon the bridge and ditch.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time M. the Prince advanced towards <hi>Emerick,</hi> which made no reſiſtance, the Dutch having withdrawn their Garriſon ſome days before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Emerick</hi> is a pleaſant town, ſeated on the right ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> a league above that place where the river divides, and makes the <hi>Rhine</hi> with its right branch, and the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal</hi> with its left. Tis a reaſonable good town, and its fortifications, that are all of earth, are well enough maintained. However the Dutch ſome few days before the Princes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, withdrew themſelves and quitted their Garriſon; either becauſe they thought it could not endure a Siege, or for ſome other reaſon, that I am ignorant of, &amp; cannot imagine what it ſhould be; for ſince that time we have taken ſeveral Towns not ſo ſtrong as that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had made very good Garriſons.</p>
                  <p>That morning M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> with ſome Officers, and a ſmall Guard, went to take a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63600:28"/>view of <hi>Skinksconce,</hi> and came ſo near as to be within hearing of the Garriſon: from whom we received about 40 musket, and ſeveral Canon ſhot, but they did no execution. Thereupon, having learned the retreat of the enemy, we returned back, and joyned with the reſt of the Army, near the Fort of <hi>Reés,</hi> in the mid way between <hi>Calcar,</hi> and another place called <hi>Hompel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame day M. the Prince advanced above <hi>Skinksconce,</hi> the <hi>Rhine</hi> lying between him and it, and diſcovered the enemy on the other ſide, guarding that paſſage.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Dragoons of the <hi>Colonel</hi> Regiment were commanded to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque <hi>Demecum;</hi> but that place held out ſo little a while, that they had time enough to come back, and ſhare the Glory of that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that was made two days after.</p>
                  <p>The 10 his Majeſty came to <hi>Reés,</hi> we ſtayed with M. <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Army, where we received the news of the taking of <hi>Grol</hi> by the Biſhop of Munſters Forces. That Town, if not the ſtrongeſt and moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that the Hollanders were maſters of, was yet of great conſequence to them, as lying on the Frontiers of Germany, and being excellently well ſeated; on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count twas fortified by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth. It hath five Baſtions, fair and good Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,

                  <p>The 11 his Majeſty being adviſed that M. the Prince intended to ſwim the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and endeavour to force the enemy from the other ſide, though they appear'd to be conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtrong, reſolved to be preſent in perſon at that Enterpriſe, which never had any equal, nor attended with like ſucceſs, and, as it were, diveſt himſelf for ſome time of his Title and Dignity, to ſhare with his Soldiers, under the quality of a Feild-Marſhal or private perſon, the honour of a day, that was almoſt to decide the fortune of all Holland.</p>
                  <p>To this intent he left his Army in their Quarters; and having taken with him his houſe Guard, and 2000 looſe horſe, he incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on the ſide of the River, on the right hand of <hi>Tolhuys,</hi> a ſmall Fort about a league below <hi>Skinksconce</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Betaw.</hi> The enemy, that lay intrench'd on the other ſide, in number about three or four thouſand, gave fire, and skirmiſhed all that day. We on our ſide cauſed ſome Foot to advance, whilſt we raiſed a battery of five peices of Canon. In the mean time the Army of M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> approached to paſs over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> over againſt <hi>Reés,</hi> on a float of wood:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63600:29"/>who after he had convayed over his Majeſty, with his Army and the baggage to <hi>Wezel,</hi> came down to do the like with his own Army: but the water being low, and no great wind ſtirring, they encamped at <hi>Nerdmorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and began not to paſs till the evening: and ſo the foot continued to paſs all night, and afterwards the horſe.</p>
                  <p>The 12 in the morning, his Majeſty hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſed he ſhould be glad to have the paſſage of <hi>Tolbuys</hi> ſounded, to try if it were not too deep before they ventured on it, M. the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> went immediately, and ſounded it himſelf. Thereupon command was given to horſe; and his Majeſty, vext to ſee the enemy pretend a deſire to engage, and not being able to endure thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigns, that were ſo contrary to their inclinations, without ſtaying to draw up, and not conſidering whether his Guards, <hi>Gendarmes,</hi> and light horſe were preſent or no, who were to make the firſt onſet, having found the <hi>Cuiraſſiers</hi> near at hand, he commanded them to fling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the water and croſs the river; which they did ſo briskly, that the poor M. the Marquis <hi>de la Salle,</hi> whom they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to meet in their way, received from them five or ſix dangerous wounds, as if he had been a Hollander (for indeed they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63600:29"/>took him for one) though he was clothed after the French mode, and had a white ſcarf on. Monſieur the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> was at the head of them, and did all that a good Captain and a brave Soldier could have done on the like occaſion. The Forces of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties houſe were commanded to paſs next, and to ſwim the river; which they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately did with ſo much courage and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, as ſtruck a terrour into the Enemy. They were followed by a great number of Volunteers; and immediately our Canon began to play, as alſo did that of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. In the mean time General <hi>Wurts,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Troops that guarded the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, being a ſtout and well experienced Captain, marched at the head of the firſt ſquadron, and cauſed them to advance into the water up to their Horſes bellies, having given order to all the reſt to follow him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the river, ſome on the right, and ſome on the left hand. The firſt ſquadron advanced with reſolution, and made a brisk diſcharge, at which M. the Count <hi>de Nogent,</hi> Feild-Marſhal to that Army, a perſon of a brave and daring ſpirit, received a wound in his head, which made him ſink into the water, where he was unfortunatly drown'd. But the following ſquadrons that had orders to enter the river, not daring to run that hazard, ſtayed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63600:30"/>in the rear of the former, and by that means gave liberty to our men to paſs, both on the right and the left wing, and at the ſame time to come upon them on the flank. In the mean time the Dragoons, being impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient alſo to croſs the river, though having had no order they did not dare to do it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced part of them into the water, that they might skirmiſh more commodiouſly, and never ceaſed giving fire. At length the Dutch took the rout, and the Commander himſelf, that had enter'd ſo briskly into the water, was forced to conſult his own ſafety by flight. For having comforted his men, and told them that no Nation but ours, was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch bold enterpriſes, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be able to reſiſt us, truſted his life and his honour to his Horſes feet, and at length made his eſcape, after he had fled a league or two, and ſuffered a continual loſs of his men in the purſuit. During this time, the Generals and Monſieur the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf having paſt the river, the Enemies Foot, that could not take the ſame courſe that the Horſe had done, and had nothing to hope for but death or mercy, began to mollify, and M. <hi>de Longueville</hi> with the Duke and other Volunteers were coming up to them. But M. the Prince obſerving the Enemy to yeild, and fearing the youthfull
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63600:30"/>heat of the young Gentlemen would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome bad effect, run up, crying they would cauſe his ſon to be killed: and having made all poſſible haſt, he came up to the trenches as ſoon as the reſt, and cryed out to the Enemy they were all Rogues, and if they ſhot once more, he would have them all hanged. His threats made them all lay down their arms, and cry out in their own Language <hi>Kartyr, Kartyr.</hi> But the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was, that M. <hi>de Longueville,</hi> not taking notice of what had paſt, and deſiring to free that Poſt, found a paſſage too ſoon; and falling upon the firſt Officer that he met, kill'd him on the place: and upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe he heard of <hi>Kartyr,</hi> which the Enemy demanded, he gave a ſign with his hand, and cryed, <hi>no Quarter,</hi> being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly followed by all his men that were then preſent. Thereupon the Enemy, deſpairing of their lives, betook themſelves again to their arms, and gave one ſhot more, which proved a very fortunate one to them: for at it the <hi>ſieur de Longueville,</hi> M. <hi>de Guitry,</hi> Grand Maſter of the Kings Wardrobe, M. <hi>d'Aubuſſon,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Taſſe,</hi> nephew to Monſieur the Marſhal <hi>de la Force,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Theobon</hi> were killed upon the place. Several others alſo were wounded, amongſt which were M. the Duke <hi>de Coiſtin,</hi> and M.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63600:31"/>
                     <hi>de Vivonne,</hi> M. the Prince <hi>de Marſillac,</hi> M. the Count <hi>de Saulx,</hi> the laſt in the face and the arm, after he had been ingaged in the general and a ſingle Combat: For having gone too far in the purſuit of the Enemy, he found himſelf alone with one of their Officers, who put himſelf upon his guard, and wounded the Count in his face. M. <hi>de Brouilly</hi> dyed in a ſhort time of his wounds, M. <hi>de Termes</hi> was alſo wounded, and M. the Count <hi>de Revel</hi> received a wound on his arm, and another of a musket ſhot in his thigh. M. <hi>de Beringhen</hi> was ſhot through the breaſt. The other perſons of note that were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were the Marquis <hi>de Beauveau, de Mont-revert, de Beaumont, de S. Arnoul,</hi> and which was worſt of all, Monſieur the Prince had his left arm broke at the wriſt; which accident did much retard and leſſen his Majeſties Conqueſts: for his name alone made the Enemy tremble, and they began not to make reſiſtance, till they had learnt the news of his miſhap: conſidering too that from that time Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> was obliged to command in his place, and to join the Troops of his own Army with thoſe of the King: ſo that of three Armies there remained now but two.

                  <p>The thirteenth, the Bridge of Boats, that had been making the day before, was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and the Army of M. the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at break of day to march over with M. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who from that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded alwaies in the place of his Highneſs. When they were all over they pillaged <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huys,</hi> a plain Caſtle with one great Tower, guarded only by a ditch and a wall: but being ſeated within a musket ſhot of the river, near the paſſage, a hundred looſs horſe, that had been drawn out of the Fort of <hi>Schain</hi> to ſecure that Caſtle, had time enough to give two volleys of musket ſhot, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge twice or thrice a peice of Canon that carried eighteen pound bullet charged with cartridges, before we could get over and come up to them: and afterwards they had the conveniency to retire before our coming, becauſe M. the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> who was the firſt that paſſed, had buſied himſelf in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63600:32"/>purſuit of the horſe, and M. the Prince of the foot, as was ſaid before. We found in this Caſtle ſtore of fair and good Moveables, ſome perſons alſo, that had retired thither in hope that we would not have attacqued Holland, about this Iſle, but have paſſed directly on to <hi>Yſſel,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Count <hi>Maurice</hi> were both with their Armies.</p>
                  <p>After the pillage of this Caſtle, Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> marched on cloſe after the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a party of which he overtook, and found breaking a bridge, upon the Channel that runs from <hi>Arnhem</hi> to <hi>Nimegen,</hi> over which we muſt neceſſarily paſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe men, though but a ſmall party, had a mind to finiſh their enterpriſe, perhaps becauſe they thought they might be ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the reſt of the Army, that was not gone far; but having skirmiſh'd a little with the Vanguard, the Dragoons lighting of their horſes, ſet upon them ſo vigourouſly, that they gave them the rout, and forced them into <hi>Arnhem.</hi> And finding themſelves well enough at the end of a bridge that lyes over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and reaches from this Town to the Iſle of <hi>Betau,</hi> they lodged there, maugre the Canon and musket ſhot of the Enemy, that fortunately killed more horſes then men.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:63600:32"/>
                  <p>His Majeſty having call'd a Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the departure of M. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> as ſoon as it was ended began to march towards <hi>Emerick,</hi> to joyn with his Army, which all this time lay in their Quarters at <hi>Reés.</hi> The Army alſo, that had been commanded by M. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> came thither likewiſe, and made up one body with that of the King. The Troops that had followed his Majeſties two days before, and thoſe of his own <hi>Houſe</hi> did the like.</p>
                  <p>M. the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> natural Son to the King of England, arrived the ſame day at the Camp at <hi>Emerick,</hi> with 7000 foot, that were all brisk and active men. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> that day conſecrated anew the great Church of <hi>Reés.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his Majeſty reſted with his whole Army, at the Camp of <hi>Emerick.</hi> After dinner he viſited M. the Prince (who the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had cauſed himſelf with the reſt that were wounded, to be removed into this Town) and at his return took a view of the Duke of <hi>Monmouths</hi> Forces. Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſeeing his affaires ſo well advanced before <hi>Arnhem,</hi> reſolved to lay ſiege to it, and thereupon having taken a view of it, and taken up his Quarters, he ſammoned the Town.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, that no time might
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63600:33"/>be loſt, M. the Count <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> employed ſome men about repairing the boats that the Enemies had began to break, as being neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for our paſſage; but in that action he was killed with a Canon ſhot to the great regret of the whole Army. The Dragoons, which were much incommoded by a guard of the Enemy placed in a redoubt on the other ſide of the river, were reſolved to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the paſſage, which, after orders were given, they performed with ſo much reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſucceſs, as ſtruck a terrour into the Town; whereupon the Burghers began to mutiny, and at length forced the Garriſon to leave of firing.</p>
                  <p>The Fame of General <hi>Wurts</hi> defeat, and of our entrance into <hi>Betaw,</hi> was not long a ſpreading, and the noiſe of it no ſooner came to the ears of the Prince of Orange, who with his Army guarded the paſſage of <hi>Yſſel,</hi> but the Enemy, being daunted with the news, thought of nothing but a retreat, which was done in ſo great haſt, as terrified all the places through which they paſſed.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> ordered 150 horſe under the command of a Captain of the horſe of <hi>Condé,</hi> to ſwim the river, and to fall on their rear Guard, that paſſed pretty near <hi>Arnham.</hi> The Enemy little expecting this attaque, as thinking themſelves ſecured
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63600:33"/>by the River, were ſo ſurpriſed at this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, that the Guard of the Baggage aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned it all to thoſe few horſe, who made themſelves maſters of it at their leaſure, and returned loaded with ſo great a booty, that they had enriched themſelves by it, though they had not joyned to it the two other of, which they had alſo the ſpoile, which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no leſs then fourty thouſand Francks. The ſame day M. the Cardinal <hi>de Bouillon</hi> conſecrated anew the great Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 15. The Kings Army reſted, and His Majeſty took a view of it after dinner.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Summons that M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> had given to <hi>Arnhem,</hi> the Citizens began to mutiny, and threatned the Garriſon to cut all their Throats if they fired any more; whereupon they came and demanded Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: but M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſent them to the King, and immediatly marched away with the greateſt part of his Army, to beſiege <hi>Knotzembourg,</hi> otherwiſe called the Fort of <hi>Nimigen,</hi> becauſe it is ſeated on the right ſide of the <hi>Wahal,</hi> directly oppoſite to that great Town, that lies on the left hand. He arrived thither time enough to open his Trenches that Evening, it being but three little Leagues from <hi>Arnhem.</hi> That Night we worked with ſo much ſucceſs, as to lodge
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63600:34"/>our ſelves on their Counterſcarpe, by which we became Maſters of their covered way, but not without ſome difficulty, and the loſs of ſeveral Men: for they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Fort very briskly, and gave continual fire from the Town; beſides three Boats, each of them provided with 8, 10, or 12 pieces of Canon, came round, and fired at us with full Charges at about thirty paces diſtance. During all that Night, there was fired ſo great a number of Canon-ſhot, that thoſe that heard it from <hi>Emerick,</hi> where His Majeſties Army lay, could not imagine where ſo continual a noiſe ſhould be made: but from another place where the noiſe could not plainly be heard, one would have thought they had been Musket-ſhot, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an engagement of ſome Foot.</p>
                  <p>The 16. His Majeſty early in the Morning parted with all His Army from <hi>Emerick,</hi> and encamped at <hi>Latem</hi> upon the River <hi>Yſſell,</hi> or rather the Channel of <hi>Druſus.</hi> A branch of this River that runs from <hi>Arnhem</hi> to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esburg,</hi> is a Channel that communicates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Yſſel,</hi> which was made by <hi>Druſus</hi> in the time of the Romans, whence 'tis called the Channel of <hi>Druſus,</hi> or the <hi>Druſian</hi> Ditch. In the mean time we advanced to <hi>Zevenaer,</hi> a ſmall Town, that hath no other Fortification but its Ramparts,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63600:34"/>ſo that we made our ſelves Maſters of it without any great difficulty. Preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, M. the Count <hi>de l' Orge,</hi> and M. the Marquis <hi>de Ranes,</hi> had command to paſs the <hi>Yſſel;</hi> the one with 4000 Horſe, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Regiment Royal</hi> of Dragoons, to take the places that lie before <hi>Doesburg,</hi> which immediatly they did. But the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of <hi>Arnhem</hi> having came to the King, and brought the Keys of their Town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conditions, His Majeſty in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon gave order to the M. <hi>de Ranes</hi> to go with his Dragoons to take poſſeſſion of the Town. M. the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi> went thither alſo; and the Inhabitants had granted them a freedom of their Religion, with all their Priviledges, but the Garriſon were made Priſoners of War, and diſarmed, to the number of 3000 Foot and 200 Horſe, which were very ſufficient to have defended the place. The Dragoons were hardly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Gates, when 200 Bores that came to the Garriſon with Proviſion, deſired entrance; whom we ſuffered to come in, and afterwards made Priſoners with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arnhem</hi> is a great Town, ſeated on the right ſide of that Branch of the <hi>Rhine</hi> which keeps its name, and waſhes the Walls of the Town. Its ſituation is partly high, partly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63600:35"/>low, being commanded on that ſide that looks towards the <hi>Velue</hi> by a Hill, which to repair the Injury it doth it, ſends down a torrent of Water, that defends it on the other ſide by a great flat bottomed Ditch, all lined with Free-ſtone, which is the faireſt and largeſt that one ſhall any where ſee, and which doth almoſt ſurround the Town, except on that ſide where the <hi>Rhine</hi> waſhes the Walls, and doth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defend it. For the reſt, the Hollanders have taken care enough, and bin very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in fortifying it; and I may very well affirm, They have not very many Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo good as theſe. They are all lined with Brick, which is not ordinary in their other Towns. The Ramparts alſo are very fair and large. To conclude, all things are very good, and it might be very well look'd upon as one of their beſt Towns.</p>
                  <p>At nine in the Evening, M. the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> brought thither the Regiment of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi> and the Dragoons came back and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped on the ſide of the <hi>Yſſel.</hi> In the mean time M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> continued to ſtorm the Fort of <hi>Nimigen,</hi> which defended it ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all day with equal force: but having fired alſo on the Boats, they were run a ground ſo well, that the Enemy fearing leaſt in the night we ſhould make our deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63600:35"/>the Ditch, and ſo enter the Town, they rendred themſelves up, after having killed 1000 or 1200 Men, of which the Sieur <hi>de la Plaſtriere,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment <hi>Lyonnois,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>Alſan</hi> the ſon, Lieutenant of the <hi>Colonel</hi> of <hi>Champagne,</hi> were the principal. M. <hi>Magalotty</hi> Camp-Marſhal, loſt a Finger of one Hand, and was hurt in the other.</p>
                  <p>The 17. in the Morning, the Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> repaſs'd the <hi>Yſſel</hi> with his Dragoons, upon a Bridge of Boats which he made over it, and went and joyn'd with the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which by reaſon of a great maras was forced to turn back by the way of <hi>Zovenaer;</hi> and then paſſing by <hi>Dutecum</hi> went and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd <hi>Doesburg.</hi> M. the Prince removed to <hi>Arnhem,</hi> that he might not be far from the King. M. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who came himſelf to acquaint the King with the taking of <hi>Knotzembourg,</hi> return'd immediatly, and caus'd us to march towards <hi>Skenksſconce,</hi> which ſince our paſſage over the River had been block'd up. The Marquis of <hi>Sauvebeuf,</hi> who, as has been ſaid, was hurt before <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht</hi> the 24. of <hi>May,</hi> and there taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, came back to the Camp cured of his Wounds, and without having paid any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, by the means of the generous C. <hi>Rhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> who, together with the Spaniards in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63600:36"/>Garriſon (whoſe Commanders had taken his part) had a conteſt with the States and Dutch party upon that account; for though the Dutch were willing enough to releaſe him, yet they were very eager for to have him pay his ranſom firſt: But at laſt, after a great diſpute on both ſides, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards threatned to forſake the Town if they would not agree; which made the States conſent to give him his liberty freely, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Paſs to return to the Army.</p>
                  <p>The 18. The King ſummon'd <hi>Doesburg,</hi> but the Governor refuſing to hearken to the Trumpeter, or receive the Letter he brought, His Najeſty ordered preparations to be made to attaque it. Faggots and Gabions were commanded to be provided, which was done with all diligence. The Count <hi>de Lorge</hi> who lay on the other ſide of the River with 4000 Horſe, advanced toward the Town, to hinder any Succors from being put into it that way. M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> cauſed Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be open'd againſt <hi>Skenksconce,</hi> in which was a Garriſon of 1900 Men. The ſame day, about four of the clock, M. <hi>de Rochefort,</hi> Captain of a Company of the Life Guards, and Lieutenant General in this Campagne, who had receiv'd Orders to be ready to march with 4000 Horſe, ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward only with 1800, becauſe at ſo ſhort
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63600:36"/>warning the Victuallers had not had time to bake Bread enough for ſo great a number. M. <hi>de Genlis</hi> was given him for his Camp-Marſhal. The Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> ſet forward likewiſe with the Regiment Royal of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons. We ſwam our Horſes over the <hi>Yſſel,</hi> and march'd on all the reſt of that day, and the night following, without drawing bit.</p>
                  <p>The 19. was ſpent in preparations for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of Trenches before <hi>Doesburg,</hi> in making Faggots, Gabions and Bridges for communication. M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> on his ſide ſo vigorouſly aſſaulted <hi>Skenksconce,</hi> that the Garriſon beginning to be diſheartned, and diſpairing of any ſuccor, were thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on capitulating; which M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting, ſent the <hi>Colonel</hi> Regiment of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons to attaque the Fort of S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> which made no long reſiſtance, though there were in it 200 Men; and it be, I think, the beſt Fortreſs the Enemy hath. It lieth in the narroweſt place of the Iſle of <hi>Bommel,</hi> compaſt with five good Baſtions, and water'd almoſt quite round by the River <hi>Wahal,</hi> ſo that it is impoſſible to drain its Ditches, and almoſt ſo, to make any Bridge over them without the conſent of the Beſieged. M. <hi>de Rochefort,</hi> with whom as I ſaid we ſwam the <hi>Yſſel,</hi> and march'd all night, continued ſtill his march all this day, ſo that we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63600:37"/>23 hours continually on Horſe-back without drawing Bit.</p>
                  <p>At two of the clock in the Afternoon, as we came out of a very fine Village, which we found deſerted, our Van-guard diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Body of Foot; which aſſoon as we went about to purſue, ſav'd themſelves in the neighboring Woods, which made us think they were only ſome Peaſants, or ſome that had been laid in Ambuſh by Count <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> whoſe Army we were in purſuit of. At laſt we came to <hi>Amerfort,</hi> with deſign to attaque and take it by aſſault; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who had ever ſince the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his flight, kept ſome at the top of a Steeple to give them notice of our coming (that they might not fall into the Trap we had laid for them) and being advertized of our coming, came out before us, and obtain'd the free uſe of their Religion and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Rights and Priviledges, open'd their Gates to the Marquis <hi>de Ranes,</hi> who entred the Town with the Regiment Royal of Dragoons which he had brought with him, and ſtaid there until the 27 of the ſame Month. The Sieur <hi>de Mazelles,</hi> a Captain of Horſe, having at the ſame time been drawn out (with his Company, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 50 <hi>Maiſtres,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neval</hi> Captain of Dragoons, with 100 <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres</hi>

At his arrival, he made all the noiſe he could with Drums &amp; Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, beating and ſounding divers Marches, and afterwards ſummon'd the Town; which being terrified and ſurprized, the Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters of it came out to Treat, which they ſpun out ſo long, that the Garriſon had time to make their eſcape: And when they were all gone, they open'd their Gates and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. As ſoon as he was in the Town, he made enquiry to know if there was no Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the place, and was told there was not; but conſidering that place to be of too much importance to be left without a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon by the Hollander, he caus'd one of the Burgomaſters to be apprehended, and told him, They ſhould all loſe their Heads, for not diſcovering to the King truly whether there were any Soldiers in the Town. Theſe threats made them confeſs, That truly there had been ſome there, but as ſoon as they heard the noiſe of the French Troops, they had fled towards <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> whereupon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63600:38"/>he immediatly caus'd the Gates to be open'd, and went out in purſuit of them; and at the ſame time order'd his Lieutenant, with ſome Horſe, to follow the Enemies Horſe, who were not yet out of ſight; and were ſome a Horſe-back, and others on Foot, their Horſes being laden with their Baggage. The Lieutenant purſued them to the Gates of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> got the greateſt part of their Baggage, and in his way homewards ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd <hi>Muyden,</hi> which not finding in caſe to make any reſiſtance, he entered, and was maſter of it for 2 hours: but at laſt finding himſelf to weak to keep that place, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to fetch more Men; but in the mean time things put on another face. At the ſame time the Sieur <hi>de Mazelles</hi> on his ſide, had purſued the Foot, which took the way of the Fields and encloſures, and paſſing over 3 Bridges, ſtill broke them as ſoon as they were got over, ſo that he was forced to his Horſes ſtrength to follow them. But the third time as he ſwam, his Horſe was mired, ſo that taking only his Piſtols, he left him there and follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d on, only accompanied with about 20 more of his Company, who making up to them upon the very mouths of their Muskets, at laſt took almoſt all the Soldiers, and two of their Captains Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

Monſieur <hi>de Rochefort</hi> left <hi>Amersfort</hi> in the morning, and with a party of horſe march'd towards <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and by the way heard that <hi>Naerden</hi> was taken, and that the Count <hi>Maurice</hi> was not far from it. M. <hi>de Rancs</hi> came back to <hi>Amersfort,</hi> and took with him 150 horſe, 50 of which were Dragoons, and we march'd all night that way. In the mean time the Marquis <hi>de la Trouſſe,</hi> who had been out by the King with 3 Squadrons to march towards <hi>Zutphen,</hi> frighted them of that place not a little, ſo that the Burgomaſters conſidering that the longer they held out, the worſe conditions they ſhould have, and that on the other ſide
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63600:39"/>they could hope for no ſuccours, ſent to let him know that they deſir'd they might ſend Deputies to the King to Capitulate for them, and that their Governour would not be againſt it: the Marquis <hi>de la Trouſſe</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inform'd his Majeſty of what had paſs'd, whereupon <hi>Monſieur</hi> prepar'd to march thither, and in the mean time the Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> ſent ſome Dragoons to the Caſtle of <hi>Em,</hi> who poſſeſt themſelves of it.

                  <p>The 21 the Garriſon of <hi>Doesburg,</hi> which the night before were as quiet as if they had been a ſleep, began to beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the morning, and at break of day began to fire very furiouſly: but this hinder'd us not from going on in our work happily enough, and with little loſs, ſo that the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries were made fit to play.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monſieur</hi> being come to <hi>Zutphen,</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd it, but they abſolutely refus'd to yeild it up, which ſo much the more incenſed his Royal Highneſs, becauſe the day before they had ſent to propoſe the yeilding it.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis of <hi>Ranes</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Naerden</hi> about 2 of the clock in the morning, he rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63600:40"/>the Garriſon with 50 Dragoons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe 100 which were there already, with the Company of the <hi>Sieur de Marelles,</hi> upon notice that Count <hi>Maurice</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about with his Troops, and that he had put 2000 men into <hi>Muyden</hi> (which he had that day done ſo ſuddenly, that the Lieutenant, who had been maſter of it 2 houres, and went to fetch more men to put into it, when he came back, found the Enemy poſſeſt of it) and had now retrench'd himſelf on the other ſide of the ſtream of <hi>Weſep.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> at laſt made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Skenksconce,</hi> and then turn'd his Arms to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Nimegen.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Skenksconce</hi> is a little hole (as I may ſay) ſo famous that it were unneceſſary to ſay any thing of it, but it is alſo of more than ordinary concern to the Poſſeſſours, becauſe of its ſituation, which is juſt on the point of the Iſland <hi>Betaw,</hi> juſt where the <hi>Rhine</hi> divides it ſelf into two great arms, whereof one retains its own name and runs towards <hi>Arnhem,</hi> and the other takes the name of <hi>Wahal,</hi> and leads to <hi>Nimegen.</hi> No Veſſel can go up or down either River without their leave, who are Maſters of this Fort; ſo that it is the Key which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opens or ſhuts up all communication between <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> This makes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63600:40"/>it of very great importance; for no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize as Rheniſh Wine, Timber, and chiefly Firr-trees, which continually come down that way from <hi>Switzerland, Suaveland,</hi> and other places of <hi>Germany,</hi> and bring a great income both to thoſe who ſend for them thence, and alſo to thoſe who ſell them again at ſecond hand to other Nations, who come thither to buy them; ſo that the trade both of theſe Commodities, and a hundred more, cannot go on without the leave of this Fort. And as its ſituation is moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, ſo is its ſtrength proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for on 2 ſides Nature hath ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd it with the defence of this great River, that it is not to be ſet upon that way, and on the other, which is that that faces the Iſle, Art hath fortified it with a great ditch full of water, good Baſtions and half Moons, and a ſtrong Rampart, which make it in a manner impregnable. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Country round about, who can ſtill remember former Wars, do aſſure us it was always thought impregnable, and in Hiſtory we never find it ever was taken above twice, the firſt time in the year 1636, when a certain Captain of a Garriſon in <hi>Guelderland</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> call'd <hi>Enhoolt,</hi> being very much incens'd againſt the Hollanders, for putting divers of his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63600:41"/>friends and kindred to death, took it by ſurprize, ſo that this can hardly be called a taking of it: the ſecond time was after a Siege which will be remembred many ages to come, ſince it laſted 8 months, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd ſo many men before it, that in many places it is yet known by the name of the French burying place, for they had then taken part with the Dutch, and did with their blood purchaſe there both Glory and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. It is likewiſe reported that when it was taken, there were left in it but 12 men, who did even then maintain the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deventer,</hi> at laſt being tired out by the Biſhop of <hi>Munſters Granados,</hi> yeilded, and it's Garriſon march'd out with their arms towards <hi>Nimegen,</hi> with a Convoy, but ſo weak a one, that when they came near <hi>Zut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,</hi> the Hollanders in ſpight of the Convoy, caſt themſelves into it, and this recruit it was which made the Governour change his mind, and deny to yeild up the Town to Monſieur, as he himſelf had propos'd the day before.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> having viſited <hi>Naerden,</hi> and left good directions for the preſervation of that Place, departed thence about 6 of the clock for <hi>Amersfort,</hi> and left the Burgomaſters of <hi>Muyden</hi> not a little confounded for having profer'd the Keys
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63600:41"/>of that Town, when it was no more in their power to let him into it, and even them ſelves were ſhut out of it. The ſame day Deputies from the States left <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to come and find the King at <hi>Doesburg,</hi> whoſe Garriſon attempted to make a ſally, but without any ſucceſs, for they were preſently repulſed.</p>
                  <p>The 22 the <hi>Sieur Martinet</hi> Camp-Maſter to the Kings Regiment, appointed Governor of <hi>Emerick,</hi> and Camp-Marſhal in this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, imagining that ſome perſons did dayly watch him out of a ſuſpition, that he had not ſo much courage as he pretended to, did all that day and night run himſelf upon all dangers, and ſo fortunately, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any wound, he advanc'd with his party much further among the Enemies Poſts then could be expected; ſo that by ill fortune the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Iſle of <hi>Yſſel,</hi> and was order'd to ſhoot croſs way upon a Poſt of the Enemies, not being aware that the ſaid <hi>Sieur Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet</hi> had already gain'd it, plaid upon it, ſo that <hi>Martinet</hi> was kill'd by a Canon ſhot; the ſame ill fortune took away the <hi>Sieur Sourry</hi> a Switzer Captain, and the <hi>Sieur Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> who was appointed Governour of <hi>S. Menehould.</hi> This gave occaſion to ſome who delight in railery, to ſay, that <hi>Doesbourg,</hi> which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63600:42"/>the Hollanders had taken ſuch pains to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, and had 4500 men in it (who yeilded themſelves up to mercy) had coſt the King but one Swallow, one Mouſe, and one Worm, <hi>from the ſignification of the French names,</hi> for indeed the Place yeilded upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doesburg</hi> is a Town which hath not been long famous, and indeed was at firſt very inconſiderable, but ſince the Hollanders have found the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Yſſel</hi> to be ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the preſervation of their Country, they thought fit to fortifie all the Places that lye upon that River, and chiefly this which is ſituate juſt where the Channel of <hi>Druſus</hi> mingles its waters with thoſe of this river. So that at preſent it is in a very good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, having good Fortifications, which for the moſt part are coated on the outſide. It is ſtrengthned on one ſide by the River, and on the other by a great Marſh, which lies between it and <hi>Arnhem,</hi> which altogether hinder it from being any way acceſſible, but by one neck of Land.</p>
                  <p>This place yeilded notwithſtanding this day upon the ſame terms as did the reſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards his Majeſty ſent <hi>Monſieur</hi> a recruit of 4000 foot and 1500 horſe, becauſe he had with him but 6000 foot and 200 horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. His Majeſty ſent him likewiſe the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the Capitulation at <hi>Deesburg,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63600:42"/>
                     <hi>Monſieur</hi> cauſed <hi>Zutphen</hi> to be again ſummoned, and ſent the Governour a ſight of the Articles of the Capitulation at <hi>Does<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg;</hi> but this taking no effect, his Royal Highneſs caus'd many faggots to be made, and in the evening had the Trenches open'd by the Regiments of <hi>Normandy, Turenne,</hi> and <hi>Orleans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> continued battering <hi>Nimegen</hi> from the Fort of <hi>Knotzembourg,</hi> without attaquing it on any other ſide; but ſent and took in <hi>Worm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sieurs de Rochefort</hi> and <hi>de Ranes</hi> went to <hi>Naerden,</hi> and drew near to <hi>Muyden,</hi> to take a view of the Enemy, who appear'd in great numbers upon a Baſtion, but never offer'd to ſally out. From thence they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Amersfort,</hi> whither came alſo a party of Muſqueteers and 1800 horſe from the Kings Army. The body of Monſieur the Count <hi>de Nogent,</hi> who had been kill'd by a musket ſhot, as he ſwam the <hi>Rhine,</hi> was found about 3 leagues lower, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the great Church at <hi>Zevenaer</hi> with all poſſible State.</p>
                  <p>News was brought to the King of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter</hi>'s being taken by the Confederate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Cologne,</hi> and that <hi>Swol, Campen, Elburg, Alderwick, Haſſelt, Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> and <hi>Ommen</hi> had upon the ſingle ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63600:43"/>of a Trumpet, drove out their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and received thoſe ſent them by the Confederates.</p>
                  <p>The 23 Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſent news to the King, of the taking of the Forts of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Worm's,</hi> which are the Keys to the Iſland of <hi>Bommelle.</hi> Before <hi>Zutphen</hi> the Canon was in a condition to play by break of day, and did the Enemy conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dammage. An hour before day, the beſieg'd tried to give a falſe Alarm, but it ſucceeded not as they hop'd: for the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier <hi>de Lorraine,</hi> who had not ſtirred from that Trench, diſcovered their deſign, and kept the Soldiers in due order. At 2 in the morning Monſieur <hi>de Rochefort,</hi> who had return'd to <hi>Amersfort,</hi> left it again to go with all his horſe, as well thoſe who came the laſt night, as thoſe which were in the Town before, and encamp'd at the Gates of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> between the Town and the Enemy. The Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> ſtayed at <hi>Amersford</hi> with his Royal Regiment of Dragoons, and in the evening caus'd all things neceſſary for an Aſſault to be carried upon the works, that they might be ready in caſe of need. About nine in the morning the ſame day, the <hi>Sieur Hotain,</hi> a Colonel of the <hi>Munſter</hi> Troops, who then commanded a flying Party, came before the Town, and ſummon'd it, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63600:43"/>it was already poſſeſt, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Army to make a halt, and gave order that 800 horſe and 500 Dragoons, which he commanded, ſhould refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Afterwards he deſir'd he might come in and ſalute the Governour; which he did, and breakfaſted with him, he, and 3 or 4 more of his Company. He confirm'd the news of <hi>Deventer,</hi> and of the deaths of M. <hi>de Gerzey,</hi> and M. <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> Camp Maſter to a Regiment of horſe, who in a ſally which the Enemy made, beat them back into the Town, but having engag'd himſelf beyond poſſibility of retreating, receiv'd a great many wounds, of which he dyed on the place, as well as the <hi>ſieur Mallet,</hi> a Captain of horſe in the ſame Regiment, and the <hi>ſieur Mauvoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiniere</hi> his Lieutenant. The ſame perſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd he had newly made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Elbairg</hi> and <hi>Harderwick,</hi> which are two little Towns above <hi>Campen,</hi> near <hi>Zuiderzee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After breakfaſt, as he took leave, he ſaid he was going to raiſe contribution of all the places that depended upon thoſe two Towns, and that he had taxed the Peaſants at a <hi>Patagon</hi> (which is equal to a French Crown) for every Hearth, and then was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Harderwick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A party of the <hi>Colonel</hi> Regiment of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons being ſent to <hi>Waningen,</hi> took it, and

                     <hi>Waningen</hi> is a pretty Town about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Meaux</hi> in <hi>Brie,</hi> ſituated in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even Country. On the upper ſide of it there lyes a heath of 4 or 5 leagues extent in the narroweſt place, on the other ſide there are very good Paſtures, intermingled with ſome Arable land, which is very fruitful. This town lying in the midſt of many others, the States thought it unneceſſary to fortifie, but left it in its ancient condition, ſo that it hath hardly any Fortification beſides its rampart.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day a Swiſs Drummer, who had been at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to carry news of ſome Priſoners to their Relations, and to deſire them to ſend them money to pay their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, brought back word that he had been brought before Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> and mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly queſtion'd by him: that his Army within their Retrenchments did not ſeem to contain above 4000 men, that they ſeem'd much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may'd, and that all the fierceneſs which he ſtrove to put on, could not hide his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern when he heard in what condition the Kings Army was, and that the Count had taken order to let him ſee as little as might be of the diſorder and ſlenderneſs of his Army. Let us therefore give them a little leaſure to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63600:44"/>take heart again if they can, and leaving a while the continuation of our <hi>Journal,</hi> let us rejoyce with the whole Kingdome of France, at our Great Monarchs fortunate Progreſs, and the Birth of a Prince, which GOD hath now ſent Him.</p>

                  <p>ALTHOUGH Men naturally love change, and novelties carry ſtill with them ſomewhat of delight, yet there are ſome things that immediatly diſguſt us, particularly thoſe that are forc'd upon us. As God at our Creation made us free, ſo is there nothing more repugnant to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then to be forced or conſtrain'd to any thing, or deprived of that lov'd liberty, to which we were born. This it was which made the Philoſophers ſay, that nothing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is violent or forced could be of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, becauſe ſuch things directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our nature, whoſe power cannot long be withſtood, it being nothing but the Will of God impreſs'd upon his Creatures.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63600:46"/>We ought not then to think it ſtrange, that thoſe who have from their youth been brought up under one kind of Government, ſhould find a great deal of difficulty in wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves from that, and accuſtoming themſelves to live under another, ſeeing it is natural to us ſo to do, and the very irrational Creatures do as much by inſtinct: as we ſee every day in Horſes, who if they have been us'd to the Saddle cannot without much difficulty be brought to draw; and Dogs that have been us'd to hunt, will not without much trouble be brought to couch when their game is in view. It is a common ſaying that a Monkey will never leave his Apiſh tricks, and that a Fox will ever love Geeſe to his laſt: and ſo it is with Men, for thoſe who have liv'd under a Monarchical State, are very hardly brought to be contented with Democracy, and all men think that kind of Government beſt, under which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have been brought up. So that, though the French yoake be much leſs greivous to the Subject then that which the States have laid on the People of Holland (amongſt whom the very Servants pay Taxes out of their wages) yet we had great reaſon to watch very carefully over thoſe whom we had now lately conquer'd, upon the account of what we mention'd before, leaſt Nature
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63600:46"/>ſhould prevail in them, as it uſually doth in other Creatures. But good Fortune, which hath always attended the French Arms, and that peculiar bleſſing which Heaven hath beſtow'd on our King, of being equally both fear'd and belov'd where ever he goes, had taken care to make our ſuſpicions groundleſs, by inſpiring into the People of thoſe Countreys as ſtrong inclinations, and as much love towards his Majeſty, as was to be found in the hearts of his moſt Loyal French Subjects; and we did very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſcover in many of them ſo greedy and earneſt a deſire of ſeeing us, that in many places they were even afraid, leaſt we would not come and take their Towns; and I have been told they deſir'd nothing ſo much as to become his Majeſties Subjects, and fear'd nothing more then not to be ſo. The timely courſe that all the Province of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> took, doth ſufficiently juſtifie what I have ſaid, and it is likewiſe certain that had not the States gone in good time to <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the Inhabitants of that great Town were thinking of delivering us up the Keys: But thoſe blood ſucking Leeches, whoſe power would by this means have come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and who could no longer have fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enrich'd themſelves with the ſpoyles of the poor Subject, hinder'd their deſign,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63600:47"/>inſpiring into them a falſe and imaginary kind of courage, which they took from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and by which they let themſelves be miſled, never thinking of that happineſs and quiet which their neighbours did now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy under the French Government, and how much they were pleas'd with the change. Their rejoycing at it did viſibly appear, when they firſt heard the news of the birth of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> which every body with one voice did congratulate; and for Joy Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires were made in all places, every body ſtriving who ſhould with moſt zeal ſhew his reſentment of ſo welcome news. But it will not perhaps be impertinent here to inform the Reader how that this kind of Ceremony is by them perform'd in a much different way from what we do on the like occaſions in France: for whereas we do generally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble our ſelves together to ſome Public place, where a great Fire is made on the Public charge, no man contributing any thing more to it then he needs muſt, though he defire never ſo much to be thought a good Subject; with them on the contrary, every Houſe-keeper makes a fire before his door, and the greater the fire it is the ſign of the greater zeal; neither do they make their fires by piling of wood up, but fixing a ſtake, at the top of which they faſten pitch barrels and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63600:47"/>ſuch like combuſtible matter, which being lighted, they make merry and ſing about it in the ſame manner as we do.</p>
                  <p>The 24 his Majeſty ſent a ſupply to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,</hi> that he might haſten the reducing of <hi>Zutphen,</hi> where the ſame day we made our ſelves maſters of a Sluce which did us good ſervice in draining the ditch. The beſiedg'd made a ſally hoping to regain it, but they were beaten back into the Town without being able to do any thing. The Chevalier <hi>de Lorraine</hi> behav'd himſelf bravely on that occaſion, and us'd them ſo ſeverely that they have not ſince dar'd to ſhew themſelves. The Regiments of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>des Vaiſſeaux</hi> were in their turns reliev'd by thoſe of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelnau</hi> and <hi>de la Reine,</hi> who gain'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp, which put the Enemy into no little fright, ſo that they now began to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deſperate condition they were in.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>de Turrenne</hi> ſeeing that the playing of the Cannon from <hi>Knotzemburg</hi> did not ſo work upon thoſe of <hi>Nimegen,</hi> as to make them think of a ſurrender, prepar'd himſelf to lay a formal Siege to it.</p>
                  <p>As for Monſieur <hi>de Rochefort,</hi> when the Inhabitants of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> who had refus'd to admit a Dutch Garriſon, or give Count <hi>Maurice</hi> paſſage, had put two of their Gates into his hands, he caus'd them to be kept
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63600:48"/>by his Muſqueteers, and backd them with all the other forces he had with him, which were encamp'd over againſt S. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s Gate, on the border of the channel that goes hence to <hi>Leiden</hi> and ſo to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and then ſent to give notice of what had paſs'd to the King, on whom the Biſhop of <hi>Strats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> waited the ſame day.</p>
                  <p>The 25 the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> made the King a viſit, and after having made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance with the ordinary ſolemnity on ſuch occaſions, he had a private conference with him, which laſted a great while; and having din'd he return'd, having been preſented by his Majeſty with a Croſs of Diamonds of great value; afterwards his Majeſty gave audience to an Envoy extraordinary from the Elector of <hi>Tiers.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Roannez</hi> was ordered to go to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> with 3 Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions of the French Guards, as many of the Switzers, and two Companies of the life Guards, to relieve the Muſqueteers who kept that place, and the horſe who back't them.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day Monſieur <hi>de Turenne,</hi> came and din'd with the King, and inform'd him of the obſtinacy of the Garriſon and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Nimegen;</hi> afterwards he return'd back to give ſuch further orders as ſhould be found neceſſary.</p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:63600:48"/>
                  <p>At laſt <hi>Zutphen</hi> was reduced to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that the beſieg'd began to beat a Parley betimes in the morning, and deſir'd to capitulate. The Articles of Capitulation at all the places which have been won from the Hollander were in general the ſame, and therefore here as in other Places the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon was made priſoners, and the place yeilded up without any other conditions. The Chevalier <hi>de Lorraine</hi> went to receive their Hoſtages, which were a Burgomaſter and two of the Officers of the Garriſon, whom he brought to his Royal Highneſs; who granted the Inhabitants as well here as in other places liberty of Conſcience, and their Priviledges, and preſently gave notice of the buſineſs to his Majeſty: acquainting Him withall, that the number of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners was increas'd by 3000 foot and 250 horſe, beſides the Governor. I cannot but take this opportunity of doing Juſtice to <hi>Monſieur,</hi> in letting the World know that in this Siege he perform'd all that could be done by an expert General, and a valiant Soldier; he was very circumſpect and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, look'd after every thing himſelf, and was always where there was the hotteſt ſervice, going with an undaunted courage to the moſt dangerous place in all the Trenches, where many were kill'd round
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63600:49"/>about him, both with great and ſmall ſhot, he remaining all the while fearleſs; ſo that the Chevalier <hi>de Lorraine</hi> was at laſt forc'd to beg of him by all means to retire from ſo evident danger, or at leaſt to give him leave not to be in the ſame place with him, leaſt if any harm ſhould befall the Prince, he ſhould be call'd to account for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zutphen</hi> is one of the cheif Towns of the Dutchy of <hi>Guelderland,</hi> and the Capitial of <hi>Zutphania,</hi> otherwiſe call'd the County of <hi>Zutphen,</hi> to which it gives the name. It is ſituated on the right bank of the <hi>Yſſel,</hi> as it runs towards the <hi>Zuiderzee,</hi> juſt by the mouth of the river <hi>Borkel.</hi> It is one of the beſt and the ſtrongeſt places the Hollanders had, it hath 9 Baſtions almoſt all coated on the outſide, 4 half Moons, 2 horn works, and without all this a very broad ditch, beſides the inner one, which is twice as broad and flat bottom'd; it hath alſo trebble Ramparts, which make it ſtrong almoſt beyond belief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yſſeltein, Oudewater, Buren,</hi> and <hi>Croanam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> open'd their Gates and receiv'd Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons from Monſieur <hi>de Rochefort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>Maurice</hi> ſeeing himſelf ſo ſtraitned, and cloſely purſu'd, imagining he ſhould ere long be ſet upon, and not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſtrong enough to ſtand to it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63600:49"/>at length to retire ſtill further: and that he might be in ſome place where he might ſleep ſafely a while, he got on the other ſide of a great Channel, which runs on the other ſide of <hi>Weſep,</hi> and quited <hi>Myen</hi> to our mercy, but becauſe from thence there was a near way to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> they let out the waters all thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>We heard of the wounds which the Heer <hi>de Wit,</hi> the empriſon'd Counſelor, receiv'd within 100 paces of his own houſe, as he was returning home at midnight from an Aſſembly of the States; how he was ſet upon by 4 men, two of which were Citizens, and the other two Sons to a certain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour in the Court of Juſtice, who was likewiſe one of the States, called <hi>Vander Graef,</hi> who had given him divers ſtabbs in the head, neck, ſhoulder, and ſide, leaving him for dead; but that the Chirurgeons notwithſtanding affirm'd his wounds not to be mortal, and gave ſome hopes of his life, though the Aſſaſſinates, who were taken, had little hopes of theirs. However this accident did not a little fright all men, eſpecially the great ones, who now began to contrive how they might make an eſcape out of the Town, and were preparing to do it with all their Goods of value: but the multitude openly withſtood their deſign, not ſuffering
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63600:50"/>ſo much as the Miniſters of other Princes to depart.</p>
                  <p>The 26. The King left the Camp at <hi>Doeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and went to a place called <hi>Biloin.</hi> The Sieur <hi>Groot</hi> (commonly call'd <hi>Grotius</hi>) who came to mediate Peace between the King and States, return'd without doing any thing. <hi>Monſieur</hi> ſent Father <hi>Zocoli</hi> a Jeſuite, and his Confeſſor, to <hi>Zutphen</hi> in the Morning, there to ſay Maſs in a Tent which was pitcht for that purpoſe in the middle of the Town, and about 3 of the clock, after Dinner, made his entry into it, and view'd the Town with its Ramparts, and other Fortifications.</p>
                  <p>We heard the Hollander had quitted <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nep,</hi> and that Monſieur the Count <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milly</hi> was gone to poſſeſs himſelf of it; and <hi>Grave</hi> ſeem'd not to intend any reſolute reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The 27. The King left <hi>Biloin,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vann'd towards <hi>Wagemingen,</hi> after having lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> orders that the Regiment <hi>de Vendoſme</hi> ſhould go and ſecure <hi>Arnhem.</hi> About 8 in the Morning, the ſecond Bataillon of the <hi>Dauphins</hi> Regiment arrived at <hi>Amersford,</hi> together with ſome Horſe, making up in all between 8 and 900 Men; ſome of which were to ſtay there, and ſome to march on to <hi>Naerden;</hi> ſo that their arrival gave liberty to the Marquis <hi>de Ranes,</hi> and his Dragoons,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63600:50"/>which were at <hi>Amersford,</hi> to go and joyn with the Marquis <hi>de Rochefort</hi> at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> where the Duke <hi>de Roannez</hi> likewiſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd with 4500 Men of the Regiment of <hi>Guards,</hi> and two Companies of the Life-Guards, but they enter'd not into <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> that day.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the States at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> were not a little diſquieted; they ſat in Council every day, and could not any way be ſatisfied, till they had diſpatch'd the Sieur <hi>Grotius</hi> back to the King in all haſt, with new Orders, and a more ample and unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Commiſſion. The Towns of <hi>Dort, Goud,</hi> and <hi>Roterdam,</hi> began openly to proclaim the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Captain-General of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> miſuſing and Impriſoning ſome Burgomaſters, who went about to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them in it, which made others more wary how they venter'd to diſpleaſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd multitude. Soon after all the reſt follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their example; <hi>Amſterdam</hi> only excepted: which however a while after yielded, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the ſhifts and devices which the States, to whom the Peoples Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this occaſion ſeem'd a very unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſound, contriv'd to divert it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Woerden</hi> alſo open'd its Gates, and receiv'd a Garriſon from M. <hi>Rochefort. Woerden</hi> is a little Town, ſituate on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> five little
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63600:51"/>Leagues from <hi>Leiden:</hi> and therefore not far from the Camp where the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had retired, and in which he had intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, being not a little troubled to ſee us Maſters of that place; and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſo nimbly towards him, that he would not be able eaſily either to make an eſcape thence, or to enterprize any thing againſt us, though he ſhould have deſir'd it. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle belonging to this Town is very ſtrong, and the whole Town ſecure from any ſudden aſſault.</p>
                  <p>The 28. the King rais'd his Camp at two in the Morning, and went to encamp at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merongen,</hi> whither the Sieur <hi>Grotius</hi> came the ſame day. On the other ſide, Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> finding the obſtinate Reſolution of thoſe of <hi>Nimegen,</hi> in which were 4500 Men in Garriſon, order'd Faggots, Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other like Preparations to be made, reſolving the next day to open his Trenches; and caus'd likewiſe his whole Army to paſs the <hi>Wahal,</hi> that they might ſet upon the Town on the other ſide of the River, whilſt the Fort plaid upon it from this.</p>
                  <p>The Duke <hi>de Roannez</hi> enter'd <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> with his 3 Batallions of Guards to defend that place, whoſe ſtrength conſiſts more in the number of its Inhabitants (though they be very ſeditious, inconſtant and waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63600:51"/>then the goodneſs of its Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are made up only of a pretty broad, but ſhallow Ditch, and a Rampart which is very much out of repair. But as to the Buildings of the Town, they are very ſtately, neat, and coſtly, eſpecially in the heart of the Town. The little Rivolets which run through many of their Streets, do not a little contribute to the beauty of the place. The out-parts &amp; skirts of the town are likewiſe very pleaſant, having many Canals; &amp; the entry into the town is very fine. There are many pleaſant Houſes ſcatter'd about, and the Suburbs are large and convenient; about which lie many rich Meadows and Paſture Grounds (ſtock'd with abundance of all ſorts of Cattel) as far as one can ſee every way. Becauſe the Burgomaſters, when they came to yield up their Town, had deſir'd to have no Garriſon forc'd upon them, promiſing to defend the place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for his Majeſty; and being they ſtaid not till they were ſummon'd, but of their own accord had yielded up the place, it was reſolv'd they ſhould be thereupon conſider'd and kindly uſed. And that they might have no reaſon to complain, M. <hi>de Roannez</hi> pitch'd his Tents upon the Rampart, where he ſtill continu'd, as did likewiſe the reſt of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Guards after his example. The
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63600:52"/>Muſqueteers, who had kept the place ever ſince the Surrender, retir'd and encamp'd without <hi>St. Catharin</hi>'s Gate, with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de <hi>Rochefort</hi>'s Army, upon the Bank of the River that runs hence to <hi>Rotterdam.</hi> The two Companies of Life-Guards enter'd the Town, and diſperſed themſelves into divers quarters of it, where they lay upon the Guard; and afterwards the Horſe-Guards belonging to the <hi>Kings Houſhold</hi> mounted the Guard by turns, relieving one another every Morning at ſix of the Clock.</p>
                  <p>The news of Count <hi>Maurice</hi>'s retiring ſtill farther, was confirm'd to us, and that he had alſo broken down moſt of the Banks that kept out the Sea, having left only one which lay inwardmoſt ſtanding; and that thereabouts he made Intrenchments, which he very carefully guarded, and fortified with divers pieces of Ordnance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Groot</hi> (or <hi>Grotius</hi>) in his paſſage, told M. <hi>de la Fueillade,</hi> That he had a Blank to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the King if he would treat, and ſo unlimited a Power granted him, as the States had never before given to any Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary.</p>
                  <p>The 29. the King leaving <hi>Amerongen,</hi> went and encamped at <hi>Zeiſt</hi> and <hi>Stotwegen,</hi> where <hi>Grotius</hi> had Audience, and made his Propoſals for a Peace, but without ſucceſs;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63600:52"/>for the King would not admit of them: ſo that being acquainted with the Kings Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he prepar'd for his departure the next day. Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> open'd his Trenches before <hi>Nimegen,</hi> where the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd behaved themſelves like Men, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to defend themſelves reſolutly, but without making any ſally. The Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> drew out 70 Dragoons of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Royal,</hi> to ſtrengthen the Garriſons at <hi>Montfort</hi> and <hi>Iſſelſteing,</hi> and march'd with them himſelf to viſit thoſe places, and give ſuch Orders as he ſhould find neceſſary for the defence of them.

                  <p>The 30. Nothing extraordinary was done at the Kings Camp which lay at <hi>Zeiſt</hi> and <hi>Stotewegen.</hi> M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> proceeded on in his approaches before <hi>Nimegen,</hi> where the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged ſtill defended themſelves very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> after dinner. The King in Perſon review'd his whole Army very ſtrictly, and then iſſued out ſevere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions to hinder any of his Army's wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering from their own Colours, upon pain of certain death without mercy; ſo that whoever ſhould offend, they ſhould all be hang'd, and not hope that any ſhould be put to the Lot for their Lives; with command likewiſe to all Officers, That they ſhould bring in every Night to the Commander of each Body, the names of all ſuch as had been abſent from their Companies.</p>
                  <p>It was now reported, That a pail of freſh Water was worth 12 Stivers at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which are equal to 15 French Sols.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond of <hi>July,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi> came to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> where he was almoſt crowded to pieces by Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, who followed after him as an Angel ſent from Heaven, praying him with much earneſtneſs, to Bleſs and Conſecrate the Churches of the Town. The Archbiſhop of the place himſelf deſir'd it of him with much importunity, in the name of all the People; but he deſir'd to be excuſed, till he ſhould have order to do it from the King.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63600:53"/>The Marquis <hi>de Ranes,</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>de Bouflers,</hi> Camp-maſter to the Regiment Royal of Dragoons, going over from <hi>

                     <hi>Monſieur,</hi> who 2 or 3 days before had joyn'd with the Kings Army, after the taking of <hi>Zu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> where he din'd with the Chevalier <hi>de Lorraine,</hi> who treated him very ſplendidly.</p>
                  <p>The night following there chanced to be a Fire in the Town, which burnt down two Houſes; and we were told, That one of the 36 Burgomaſters of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who had been one of the 3 that had been againſt the giving up the Town to the King, when the Inhabitants would not reſolve to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as the moſt part of the reſt had done, we heard, I ſay, that this Burgomaſter had received a Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot from a Sentinel, for not anſwering in time, when he was asked, Who goes there? and that he was in great danger of death by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63600:54"/>it. And that the Sea finding no oppoſition, ſince the Count <hi>Maurice</hi>'s cutting down the Banks, did come into the Country with a dreadful impetuoſity, and had already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed a great part of the Country which lay between us and <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>de Chamilly,</hi> whom M. <hi>de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> had ordered to march towards <hi>Gennep</hi> and <hi>Grave,</hi> and make himſelf maſter of them, arrived before <hi>Gennep,</hi> thinking the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, whom the Dutch Garriſon had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, would without difficulty have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it up, but found not what he expected: for a Colonel belonging to the <hi>Brandenbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> being ordered to put ſome Forces into it, and keep it as belonging to the Elector his Maſter, having performed his Orders, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to give it up to Monſieur <hi>de Chamilly.</hi> The truth is, this little Town, which is not extraordinarily ſtrong, and lies upon the <hi>Meuſe</hi> between <hi>Ruremonde</hi> and <hi>Grave,</hi> had formerly belong'd to the Duke of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg;</hi> but having been taken from him, and long poſſeſt by the Hollander, it was now no more reckoned to be his. Wherefore M. <hi>de Chamilly</hi> reſolving not to be put off, ſent him word, That unleſs he would be gon and leave the place to him, he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly put all his Men to the Sword, and hang
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63600:54"/>him without mercy. But the Colonel being not mov'd at this Threat, the Count <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milly</hi> made his Troops immediatly prepare to aſſault the place; but then the Colonel ſearing a diſmal Halter, which he foreſaw would be his fate if he ſtood out any longer, ſent us word, That rather then diſgrace his Family with being hang'd, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any thing to avoid ſuch an ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death; wherefore, he deſired to be uſed as an Officer of the Duke of <hi>Brandenbourgs,</hi> who having not as yet declared himſelf, ought not to be reckon'd nor uſed as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; he therefore deſired, he might freely march off and return to the place from whence he came; and earneſtly entreated M. <hi>de Chamilly,</hi> that leaſt he ſhould be hang'd at his return for not maintaining the place, he would give him an Certificate under his Hand, that he was ready to give an Aſſault to the place, and had threatned to hang him before he yielded it up; which having been granted him, he retir'd into the next Garriſon, as well ſatisfied as if he had gained ſome great Victory, or done ſome memorable exploit. So that the Count <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milly</hi> preſently ordered his Men to enter the place; and then marched towards <hi>Grave,</hi> whoſe Garriſon was retir'd, and which was
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63600:55"/>now in the poſſeſſion of the Sieur <hi>Cleodore,</hi> who by order from M. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> kept the place with 40 or 50 <hi>Maiſtres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third, the Marquis <hi>de Louvoys</hi> went and viſited the Town-houſe of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and commanding the Maps of the Country to be brought him, informed himſelf of the number, bigneſs, and other qualities of the Channels which compaſs'd the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>'s Camp; that being before-hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in theſe matters, he might be ready to go and attaque him in caſe a Peace were not concluded. It muſt be confeſs'd, that the prudence and conduct of the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi> are almoſt incredible; he hath manag'd things in this Campagne, as he doth all things elſe, with marvelous vigilancy, care and ſucceſs. The Kings Troops, the care of which lay wholly upon him, were the beſt order'd that might be; nothing was wanting in the Army: he had taken ſuch care for all things neceſſary, that the King need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only wiſh that things ſhould be done, and they were ſo. He found in that Man an inexhauſtible Treaſure of all thoſe good Qualities which fit a Man for ordering bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs dextrouſly; he had eſtabliſh'd ſuch good Orders, and ſuch a way of living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Soldiers, that they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well accommodated as if they had
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63600:55"/>been in <hi>Paris,</hi> and that without any way being grievous to the Countrys where they lay. There were every where continual Fairs and Markets, to which Merchants, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualers, and Country people reſorted, with as much ſecurity as to St. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Fair. In a word, he ſo well contriv'd all things, that we never wanted any thing.</p>
                  <p>After Dinner the King came to the Camp, and having walked about it and view'd his Troops, without cauſing them to take Horſe; he alſo rounded the out-ſide of the Town, and then went into it likewiſe, but <hi>incognito.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> continu'd ſtill battering <hi>Nimegen,</hi> which did ſtill couragiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it ſelf. Notwithſtanding, he diſpatch'd a Courier to the King, to tell Him, he hop'd that very day to ſpring a Mine, or that at fartheſt it would be ſprung the next day. The Sieur <hi>de Carman,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel of the <hi>Champagne</hi> Regiment, was killed before this place.</p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>de Lorge</hi> made his Men labor hard all day about making a Bridge over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that by it he might get into the <hi>Betaw.</hi> The News of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s being choſen Statholder, and Protector of their Country, by all the Towns of the United Provinces, except only <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to us, and at the ſame time the Sieur
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63600:56"/>
                     <hi>Groot,</hi> who was this day to return and bring the King an anſwer about the ratification of the Peace, inſtead of coming himſelf, ſent to deſire, That his time might be prolong'd two days more, which were accordingly granted him. It is to be noted, That His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty would treat with him not as coming from the States (whoſe Authority he would not acknowledge) but only as from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Holland.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, nothing extraordinary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Kings Army, which continued reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refreſhing it ſelf after all the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it had undergon. M. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> after having had his deſign of mining <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megen</hi> twice fruſtrated by Countermines, at length, notwithſtanding all the Enemies care and pains to hinder it, almoſt finiſh'd one; ſo that they finding they ſhould ere long have a breach made in their Walls, and be forced to endure an aſſault, and come to handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blows with the French (which they feared above all things, as knowing how good our Nation is at that kinde of Service, and how dangerous it is to fall into their hands) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd at laſt to come to a Compoſition. The Count <hi>de Saulx</hi> had a piece of his Breeches ſhot off, and one of his Servants kill'd with him by a great ſhot before this place, which gave occaſion to the ſpreading of a rumor,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63600:56"/>that he was dead, and made him as much lamented in the Kings Army, as if he really had been ſo.</p>
                  <p>The fifth, at break of day, 2 Horſe-men from <hi>Naerden</hi> came to Monſieur <hi>de Rochfort,</hi> to give him notice of the Count <hi>Maurice</hi>'s laſt retreat, and how he had cut down the Banks and let in the <hi>Zuiderzee,</hi> whoſe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe was now ſtopp'd by nothing but only one Dike, which was only broad enough for 3 Horſe to march abreaſt on. At the ſame time M. <hi>de Rochfort</hi> diſpatch'd a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi> to give him notice of it, and M. <hi>de Roannes</hi> drew out a party of the <hi>Life Guards,</hi> which were of the Guard at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and ſome of the Kings Men at Arms, who were come thither, &amp; ſent them under the Command of the M. <hi>d'Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> to view and take cognizance of the Poſt which the Enemy now poſſeſt. They did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and ſtood within Piſtol-ſhot of their Intrenchments two long hours, none of the Enemies in the mean time daring to come out towards them; only they were free of their Musket-ſhot, which yet did no harm, ſo that our Men came back juſt as they went: which is an infallible token of the Dutch cowardize, who dar'd not ſtir out when they might have cut the whole Party to pieces: and though they had fear'd ſome
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63600:57"/>ambuſh, yet might they have come round in their Barks, and ſet on them behind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger of being any way ſurpriz'd, being ſure of a ſafe retreat when ever they deſir'd it. Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came maſter of <hi>Nimegen,</hi> which yielded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame terms as others had done, only the Governor and other chief Officers had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to depart with all their Baggage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nimegen</hi> is a very great Town, and full of Inhabitants, ſituate on the left ſide of the <hi>Wahal,</hi> which runs by its Walls, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates it from the Fort of <hi>Knotzembourg;</hi> it lies high on one ſide, and low on the other. On the higher part of the Town ſtands an old Caſtle, which is ſtill ſtrong enough, and commands both the Town and River. The lower part is plentifully furniſh'd with Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Baſtions, and Half-moons of an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive bigneſs, and upon that account they need more Men to defend it then we do in our Towns, who are more concern'd to have them well lined and flanck'd. Thoſe who have Travell'd in Holland, may have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the prodigious dimenſions of all parts of their Fortifications, ſo that each Work requires as many Men almoſt to defend it, as a whole Town of ours.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Count <hi>de Chamilly,</hi> who was march'd towards <hi>Grave,</hi> found
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63600:57"/>ſtrange alterations there, as well as he had at <hi>Gennep.</hi> Some of the States, either thoſe that were at <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> or others, hearing that their Garriſon had ſo cauſeleſly quitted the Town, which is very ſtrong, and whoſe Works are in very good repair; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withal that there were not in it above 40 or 50 of our Men, ſent a command to the Governor that had quitted it, to return thither and defend it upon pain of death; and ordered the Governor of the <hi>Buſſe</hi> to give him all poſſible aſſiſtance in caſe of need. Wherefore, upon this Order he was forc'd to turn back again, and the Governor of the <hi>Buſs</hi> took with him 33 Companies of Foot, and 100 Horſe, to go and perform what was commanded him. There being as yet no Garriſon put into the place, and the Townſmen refuſing to keep the Gates, it was eaſie for him who came before in haſt with 100 <hi>Maiſtres</hi> to enter the Town, whil'ſt the Foot followed ſoftly after; though as it prov'd, they made too much haſt to their own misfortune. He therefore viſits the place, and reckons upon thoſe Men of ours which he found there, as ſo many Priſoners. But whilſt this was doing, the Van of the Count <hi>de Chamilly</hi>'s Army was diſcover'd, and he withal gave notice of his coming, which was but ill news for the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63600:58"/>who by this means was not like to wear his Laurel long. Hereupon the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men began to change their note, and declar'd they would not ſuffer themſelves to be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by us, and therefore bid the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſhift for himſelf, which he could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe do, then by ſending to deſire a Paſs from M. <hi>Chamilly,</hi> that he might come and capitulate with him, which he did, and was ſuffer'd to return again to the <hi>Buſſe</hi> with his 100 Horſe; he mentioned not the Foot in the capitulation, which he thought was ſo far behind, that he might eaſily give them notice to retire homewards and none of us the wiſer. But to their misfortune he was out in his calculation, for M. <hi>de Joyeuſe</hi> met with them, who though he had then with him but a ſmall party of the Brigade of Horſe which he commands (the reſt being gone before under command of the Marquis <hi>de Tury,</hi> to recover the Town) he fell upon them ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, that they had only time to make one diſcharge at us. In this Encounter moſt of the Enemy were kill'd, and the reſt taken, ſo that there hardly eſcap'd one to carry home the bad news: we got at this bout 33 Colours.</p>
                  <p>The night that follow'd, and the ſixth day, there hapned a Fire in the Kings Quarters, which began in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63600:58"/>Houſe, and burnt down together with ſome others; the damage the Duke had by it was computed to amount to 100000 Crowns. The fire reached the Kings Stable, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed many Horſes and their harneſs, and at laſt grew ſo dreadful, that the King was forced to riſe, leaſt the fire ſhould alſo come to his Appartment; many of his Pages having had their cloths burnt.</p>
                  <p>We heard of the ill ſucceſs of Monſieur <hi>de Nancrud</hi>'s attempt upon <hi>Ardemburg,</hi> which had faild by his guides and ſpies ſaults, theſe having miſinform'd, and the other miſled him. The Particulars of that buſineſs were as follows; Word was brought to him that the Garriſon was both very ſmall and alſo negligent, which made him reſolve to try if he could ſurprize it; and to that purpoſe he order'd his march ſo as to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive before the Place at midnight, with a deſign to attaque it in four ſeveral places at once, but it ſo happen'd, his Guides either not being ſufficiently acquainted with the Country, or miſtaking their way in the dark, that his whole party met at the ſame place, and ſo were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c'd to make their attaque all on one ſide of the Town; which being perform'd very couragiouſly, they beat out the Enemy and gained a half Moon, which Poſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63600:59"/>greater things they cared not to ſecure from the Enemy's ſhot; but day at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to break, the Enemy who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſupplies from <hi>Sluice,</hi> now made more vigorous reſiſtance; and having diſcover'd our men, who lay leuel and open to their ſhot, kill'd many of them, ſo that they were forc'd to retire with loſs of 1000 or 1200 men.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> went to <hi>Iſſelſtaing</hi> and <hi>Monfort,</hi> leading thither ſome Dragoons to reinforce thoſe Garriſons. The ſame day about evening, the King came to viſit <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht;</hi> and he was ſcarce gone thence when the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> Embaſſadors from the King of England arriv'd, hoping to have found his Majeſty there, to whom they were ſent by the King their Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The 7 the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arlington</hi> went from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> to the Camp at <hi>Zeiſt,</hi> where the King preſently gave them Audience, after which a Courier was diſpatch'd to the King of England, who was mightily ſollicited by the Dutch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to a Peace.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy came and attaqu'd <hi>Oudwater,</hi> and beat back our horſe Guard, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed 5 or 6 of them with the like loſs on their ſide, but the Alarm being ſtreight
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63600:59"/>given to Monſieur <hi>de Rochefort,</hi> he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to their aſſiſtance, as did alſo the Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> with his <hi>Regiment Royal</hi> of Dragoons, but they at their arrival found the Enemy retir'd, ſo that all theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies kept a guard all that night upon the Place. The Muſqueteers, who ever ſince the ſurrender of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> had been either within the Town to ſecure it, or encamp'd juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it with Monſieur <hi>de Rocheſorts</hi> Army, return'd now to the Kings Camp at <hi>Zeiſt,</hi> a part of whoſe Guard they were. The three Bataillons of the Regiment of Guards, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Duke <hi>de Roannez</hi> had with him in the ſame place, did the like, and in their ſtead were ſent thither, one Bataillon of the Kings, and another of the Queens Regiment, the Regiment of <hi>Caſtelnan,</hi> the Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment <hi>de la Marine,</hi> and that of <hi>Suitzers,</hi> whoſe Colonel is the Sieur <hi>Stouppe,</hi> who alſo commanded the Place, as belonging of right to him whilſt that the King had yet appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Governour of it. The reſt of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Turenne</hi> was ſent to <hi>Naerden,</hi> to relieve thoſe of the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s which lay there, and many foot were ſent to reinforce M. <hi>de Rochefort</hi>'s Army, which his Majeſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to leave about <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> as well to keep all that part of the Country quiet, as to hinder the Hollanders Armys, which lay
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63600:60"/>not far off, from attemting any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the new conquered places that lay that way.</p>
                  <p>The eight in the morning, Monſieur <hi>de Rochefort</hi> order'd ſome powder and ſhot to be ſent to <hi>Oudewater,</hi> with a Convoy of horſe, and then he returned with the Troops he had brought the day before. The Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> came back alſo with his <hi>Regiment Royal</hi> of Dragoons: The King prepar'd to leave <hi>Zeiſt;</hi> and the Cardinal <hi>de Boüillon</hi> went and conſecrated the Church of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> which was perform'd with great pomp, to the great Joy of an infinite number of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, who impatiently expected that day.</p>
                  <p>The 9, the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Kings Army, with the Marquis <hi>de la Valiere,</hi> having left his Baggage and Equippage near <hi>Emerick,</hi> and the command of his Army to the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who came likewiſe to give the King a viſit, and then returned towards <hi>Frizeland,</hi> where ſince he hath done the Enemy much harm. The Marquis <hi>de Ranes,</hi> who during all this Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne had commanded the <hi>Regiment Royal</hi> of Dragoons, left that, and took the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Regiment <hi>Colonel,</hi> and went to the Kings Camp to follow his Majeſty. The next day, the Prince who had been
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63600:60"/>conveyed to <hi>Arnhem,</hi> and continued there ever ſince his Majeſty left that place, found himſelf worſe then he had been of his wounds, and was much tormented with a fit of the Gout.</p>
                  <p>The King gave 8000 <hi>livres,</hi> among thoſe who had loſt their horſes in the late fire.</p>
                  <p>The 10 the King left <hi>Zeiſt</hi> (which lyes within 2 leagues of <hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht</hi> to command that Army, which M. the Marquis <hi>de Rochefort</hi> left to follow the King; which Army was found to conſiſt of between 15000 and 16000 men.</p>
                  <p>The 11 in the morning, the King went and encamped in the Suburbs of <hi>Arnhem,</hi> the Government of which, together with thoſe of <hi>Nimegen,</hi> the whole Iſle of <hi>Betaw,</hi> and <hi>Grave,</hi> he beſtowed on the Count <hi>de Lorge,</hi> with a penſion of 1000 Crowns monthly, M. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who had march'd with his Army towards <hi>Grave,</hi> came to wait on his Majeſty ſoon after his arrival, and having aſſiſted at the Council which was held, returned and lay at <hi>Nimegen.</hi> The weather which had ſome days threatned a change, at laſt became very fowl, and from this day forward, rain, wind, and cold did
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63600:61"/>as much trouble us, as if it had been the middle of Winter, till we returned again into the Climate of <hi>France.</hi> This ſtormy weather was very favorable to many Towns, which otherwiſe would certainly have been taken as others had been.</p>
                  <p>The 12, the King left <hi>Arnhem,</hi> and having paſſed the <hi>Rhine,</hi> over a Bridge of Boats made for that purpoſe a little below the Town, marched through the Iſle <hi>Betaw,</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Wahal</hi> alſo upon a Float over againſt <hi>Nimegen,</hi> where he lay that night. All the former night and this day we wrought hard in making a Bridge, to paſs over the Army, Artillery, and Baggage, but not being able to ſiniſh it time enough, one part of the Army was forced to ſtay in the Iſle till the next day. Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> left <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megen</hi> betimes in the morning, and went to <hi>Grave,</hi> where he found his Army paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> over a bridge of boats which had been, made above the Town, and the Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> met there a part of the Regiment <hi>Colonel</hi> of Dragoons, which had ſtaid there for the defence of the Place, whilſt the reſt were gone to joyn with the Count <hi>de Chamilly</hi>'s Army, which lay beyond the <hi>Buſſe,</hi> between that Town, <hi>Heuſden</hi> and the Fort <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> at a place called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> As ſoon as the whole Army had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63600:61"/>the River, we march'd on and went to encamp at <hi>Bergen,</hi> which is within three leagues of <hi>Grave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt not forget to let you know, that <hi>Grave,</hi> though it be but a little Town, yet is one of the prettieſt, pleaſanteſt, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and eaſilyeſt defended places, that I have ſeen. It is ſituated on the right bank of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> which does very much ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it on that ſide, and on the other ſide it hath a great marſh, always full of water, which makes it inacceſſible at all times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it hath excellent Fortifications, and in good repair, but above all a great Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work very well ſecured with a covered way, which goes to the very Gate, with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ravelins, beſides a good Counterſcarp, and a Palliſado which is but newly made, and is in very good order, and ſtrong Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks: ſo that I may truly ſay that I have not ſeen in <hi>Holland</hi> a prettier Town, better in order, or in a likelier condition to defend it ſelf. It hath been often taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, the firſt time was in the year 1586, when the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> beſiedged it, and had it ſurrendred to him upon Articles; and then it was again retaken in 1602, by Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and ſince hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The 13, becauſe of the Bridges not being
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63600:62"/>time enough in readineſs the day before, the King kept at <hi>Nimegen,</hi> whilſt the reſt of the Army all that day paſs'd over from the Iſle of <hi>Betaw.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> paſſed from <hi>Bergen</hi> in the morning, and encamped at a Village call'd <hi>Hempel,</hi> within a league of the <hi>Buſſe,</hi> and half a league from <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> and immediately ſet his men to work about making a bridge over againſt his Camp, and at the end of the bridge rais'd a Redout to keep the Enemy from putting any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours into <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> which he intended to beſiege.</p>
                  <p>The 14 the King left <hi>Nimegen,</hi> and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>Grave,</hi> where he paſſed the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and encamp'd on the left ſide of that River. Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> went and view'd the Fort of <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> and though news came that the Inhabitants of <hi>Bommelle</hi> had ſent to the King to capitulate, he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſent a Trumpet to ſummon it. M. <hi>de Montauban</hi> advanced on the other ſide of the <hi>Buſſe</hi> with 4000 horſe. The weather began to make the Country almoſt unpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable; the cold, rain, and wind grew very troubleſome, ſo that we could hardly find the Cauſſeys, though there be no going any where elſe, the whole Country being nothing but marſhes and dikes.</p>
                  <p>The 15 his Majeſty left <hi>Grave,</hi> and came
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63600:62"/>within a league of <hi>Boxtel,</hi> a little Town near the <hi>Buſſe,</hi> but of very great importance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it commands the Sluces, which either keep in, or let out the waters, all over this part of the Country. But at this time they had no great need of them, the rain having already ſo plentifully fallen, that all about the Town was overflown, which hinder'd us from beſieging it, as we before deſign'd.</p>
                  <p>The Bridge which Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> had ordered to be made over the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> for communication between his Camp and the Iſle of <hi>Bommelle,</hi> was now finiſhed; he ordered 10000 Faggots to be prepared, and view'd the Fort again, which he found to be a very good one, and that it commands the Sluces below the <hi>Buſſe,</hi> as <hi>Boxtel</hi> doth above it. It hath 5 good and large Baſtions, though they be not coated: the Garriſon conſiſted of 800 men, who might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Place, which was ſecured on one ſide by the River, and on the other by a great unpaſſable Marſh, and which (had we not provided againſt it by ſetting a guard on the paſſage) might have kept correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the <hi>Buſſe,</hi> and been releiv'd and aſſiſted from thence as oft as they would.</p>
                  <p>The 16 the King went to <hi>Boxtel,</hi> where he found no reſiſtance. Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> as ſoon as the Faggots he had order'd were
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63600:63"/>ready, made the horſe carry them, and in the evening cauſed the Trenches to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Regiments <hi>de Champagne, Lyonnois,</hi> and <hi>de Louvigny,</hi> who advanced them very far, and raiſed a Battery on that ſide where the <hi>Champagne</hi> Regiment was, whereon were planted two peices of Canon, which were ready to play by day break. They likewiſe very much forwarded another, which was began in the <hi>Lyonnois</hi> Regiment's quarters, to plant 8 peices on. The beſiedged, who were certainly by the ill ſeaſon lulled a ſleep, and thought it not poſſible we ſhould work in ſuch tempeſtuous weather, diſcharg'd not above 7 or 8 Guns at us, which hurt no body. The Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who, as we ſaid, ſtaid at <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> with 15 or 16000 men, encamped without S. <hi>Catharin</hi>'s Gate, chang'd his quarters, and paſſing the Canale which runs from thence to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> went beyond a part of the Suburbs which lies on the other ſide, and encamped not far from the Town, between it and <hi>Naerden,</hi> after having defeated a party of the Enemy, who had ſet upon his van-Guard.</p>
                  <p>The 17 the King reſted with all his Army at <hi>Boxtel,</hi> and departed not thence till he return'd for <hi>France.</hi> In the morning as we ſaid the <hi>Lyonnois</hi> Regiment's Battery began to play upon <hi>Crevccoeur,</hi> and beat down a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63600:63"/>Redout which lay on the left ſide of the Fort toward the River, ſo that ſome Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which were in it were forced to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it, and retire to their fellows in the Fort it ſelf; afterwards 100 <hi>Grenadiers</hi> were placed upon the Channel that comes from the <hi>Buſſe,</hi> to hinder the communication of the Enemy with that place, and a Serjeunt with 20 men lodged about 30 paces from the declivity of the works, behind the ruines of a Redout, which the Enemy had quitted and fired ſome days before. The Grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Artillery came and brought with him 16 peices of Canon, 8 of which were ſent to be mounted on the Battery fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the night before in the <hi>Champagne</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments quarter. The Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> took with him all the Dragoons that were in M. <hi>de Turennes</hi> Army after dinner, and went with them to the Count <hi>de Chamilly's,</hi> with whom was the reſt of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lymen</hi> Camp: this Army was likewiſe now buſied in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying Faggots, to ſet upon <hi>Crevecoeur</hi> on their ſide alſo.</p>
                  <p>The 18 his Majeſty kept at <hi>Boxtel,</hi> where nothing extraordinary happened. The Battery of 8 peices of Canon which was begun the night before by the <hi>Lyonnois</hi> Regiment before <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> was finiſh'd and ready to play by break of day; and the Enemy ſoon were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63600:64"/>made ſenſible of it by having 6 of their Guns diſmounted in a little time; on the Count <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milly</hi>'s ſide, Trenches were likewiſe open'd, from w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they gave a falſe Alarm. M. <hi>de la. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> Lieutenant Colonel of the Dragoons, went in the morning, and cauſed all the Trees about the Avenues of his Camp to be fell'd to hinder the Enemy, who was very ſtrong in <hi>Heuſden,</hi> from ſetting on him behind, but they attemted no ſuch thing; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Marquis <hi>de Ranes,</hi> after dinner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſome of his Dragoons, march'd towards them, and beat back their Guards, and made them retire within their Palliſado, on purpoſe to entice them out to fight, but none of them ſtirr'd, only ſome volleys of ſmall ſhot were let fly at us from their works. In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Ambaſſadors, having diſpatch'd their buſineſs, took leave, and returned by <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> that ſo they might require the Count <hi>Monterey,</hi> the Governor of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> to withdraw all the Spaniſh Forces from the Dutch ſervice, or upon his refuſal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce War againſt him in the name of the King of <hi>England;</hi> and tell him that he would immediately fall to acts of hoſtility againſt the Spaniard. Monſieur <hi>de Villacerre</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied them to be a witneſs of their
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63600:64"/>Conference, and the Engliſh and French Fleet came up as far as the <hi>Texel,</hi> with deſign to land, if he refuſed aſſent to the propoſal: but the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi> made anſwer, that the buſineſs was of ſuch importance as he could not anſwer till he had acquainted his Superiors with it, and therefore deſired time till he might ſend to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and then he would act according to the inſtructions he ſhould receive thence.</p>
                  <p>An Officer that went a pickering with a party of Horſe towards <hi>Breda,</hi> met with a party of the Enemy, and though ours was but 30 againſt 80, he made them give ground, and after ſomereſiſtance wholly routed them: but 500 Peaſants, which had gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſtrongly intrenched themſelves endeavour'd to cut off the retreat of our men, ſo that they were feign to force their way, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they did happily enough through their firſt barricado, but when they came to the ſecond, the caſe was altered, for the Peaſants had ſent to the routed party of the Enemy, to bid them rally and ſet on our men behind, whilſt they would oppoſe them before, and ſtop their paſſage. The project took ſo well that they defeated our party, and though there were not many killed upon the place, yet it fared the worſe with them that ſcaped; for falling into the hands of the Peaſants,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63600:65"/>there was no ſort of cruelty which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured not from them; but they were not long unrevenged, for the King hearing of their barbarous uſage the ſame evening, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ordered a party to go and put all thoſe Villages to fire and ſword.</p>
                  <p>On the 19, which was the day following, the Chevaſier <hi>Fourille</hi> marched out by break of day with the Brigades <hi>de la Feuillée</hi> and <hi>de Roye,</hi> and 200 Dragoons which M. <hi>de Ranes</hi> had ſent him, under the command of the Chevalier <hi>de Tilladet,</hi> Camp maſter to the Regiment <hi>Collonel,</hi> with orders to burn, plunder, and put to the ſword all that they ſhould meet; and accordingly they burnt and plundered the Villages: but the Peaſants having heard of the deſign, were for the moſt part fled, ſo that few of them fell into our hands; but being very near <hi>Breda,</hi> ſome Dragoons who were commanded to ſet fire at any place where they could, went up to the very Gates of the Town, and there fired ſome houſes whilſt the reſt of the party and the Horſe defended them; this troubled the Town a little, who thought ſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that we were coming to beſiege them.</p>
                  <p>The Governor of <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> finding we ſhould now ſoon be in a condition to aſſault the Place, reſolved to ſtand out no longer, and that he might get the better conditions,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63600:65"/>went himſelf to make them; ſo he came forth and deſired to ſpeak with M. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> who gave order he ſhould be civilly intreated, but would not ſee him. He only diſarmed the Garriſon, and becauſe we had more Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners then we could well tell what to do with, he had them all conducted a league from the Place, and there gave them their liberty, as he had done before to thoſe of <hi>Nimegen,</hi> among which he had found 500 or 600 Citizens of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> whom he ſent to their own homes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hinkel</hi> which is a little Fort between the <hi>Buſſe</hi> and <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> was taken by the Count <hi>de Chamilly,</hi> with more eaſe then he himſelf did expect: for the Garriſon either being frighted, or having heard that we intended to aſſault them, quited it after having ſet fire on their powder and the houſes of the Fort, a part of which were notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved.</p>
                  <p>The 20, the King, who continued ſtill at <hi>Boxtel,</hi> having heard of the ſurrender of <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> came and viewed the Fort, and afterwards returned, whilſt M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> paſſed over the Iſland of <hi>Bommelle,</hi> and ſent and ſummoned the Town which bears the ſame name. The Inhabitants were at a ſtand what anſwer to make, on one ſide they found not themſelves in a condition to hold
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63600:66"/>out a long Siege, and deſpaired of being relieved; they likewiſe ſaw that many Towns better fortified and Garriſon'd then they, had not been able with all their ſtrength to defend themſelves; and that all the Country round about them was already in our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; but on the other ſide alſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that they had formerly born up againſt all the fury of 25000 Spaniſh foot, when their Fortifications were by no means in ſo good a condition as at preſent: and beſides a certain little Collonel, who had before been in <hi>Nimegen</hi> whilſt we beſiedged it (and who would have ſtill been among the reſt of our Priſoners had he not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed) and was afterwards made Governor of this Town, thought himſelf engaged in honour of which he had much bragged to M. <hi>de Turenne,</hi> not ſo lightly to yeild up a Place of that importance; wherefore we were forced to ſet on them, and as we came before the Place, the Guides brought M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſo near that a Cannon bullet, which had been ſhot from the Town, fell juſt at his feet; but that hindered not our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we therefore went and encamped at <hi>Stelſt;</hi> which is a little Village lying upon the River, within Canon ſhot below the Town.</p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:63600:66"/>
                  <p>Whilſt the Kings Quarters were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſome attendants, having retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a certain grove to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves till a houſe ſhould be appointed them for their Maſter, perceiv'd the ground had lately been turn'd up there, which gave them the curioſity to ſearch if nothing were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den underneath, whereupon one of them felt with his ſword, and finding ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, uncovered the place before ſome Officers that were then come thither, and there found 28 dead bodies newly kill'd, piled one upon the other, divers of which thoſe Officers knew to have been our horſe.</p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>de Chamilly</hi> left <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lymen,</hi> and went over with his Army to Monſieur <hi>de Turennes</hi> Army at <hi>Hempel,</hi> and in the mean time order'd the fort of <hi>Hainkel</hi> to be ſlighted.</p>
                  <p>The 21 about 10 in the morning, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged in <hi>Bommel,</hi> who from the top of their works could eaſily ſee that we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped upon the River, ventur'd out of the Town, without any oppoſition, fill'd a <hi>Fregate,</hi> which carried 4. or 5 pieces of Canon, with Soldiers, and coming down the River ere we were aware of them, arriv'd over againſt our Camp, where they landed and made a diſcharge of their muskets and Canon loaded with ſmall ſhot, amongſt our Tents,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63600:67"/>by which they kill'd ſome few of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, and many of their horſes: thereupon ſome of our men made up to them, and our foot beating them back to the River ſide, ſhew'd them ſo much vigour and courage in the Skirmiſh, that they retir'd to the other ſide of the River, which is out of Musket ſhot. They came back however two or three times to diſcharge again, but were ſtill repulſed, though not without difficulty and the loſs of ſome men; for the Marquis de <hi>Ranes</hi> having got between the Town and them at a place where the River is much narrower, forc'd them to ſtand one of our diſcharges, which they did, but not to be behind hand with him, anſwered it with their Muskets and Canon charged as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo that one Dragoon loſt an arm, and another a leg. But as ill fortune for them would have it, the fire caught in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der room, and ſo fired one end of their Veſſel, whereupon 7 or 8 of them for fear of being burnt, flung themſelves into the water, where they all periſh'd, being either drown'd or killed by our men, who were skirmiſhing on the ſhore, this accident fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſo, that from that time forward they dared not venter out. At the ſame time Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> ordered Faggots to be made, and ſent a Trumpet to ſummon the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63600:67"/>Place once again, the beſiedged let him in, and went to counſel, which laſted 5 or 6 hours, wherefore M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſent M. <hi>Baleroy,</hi> a Captain of horſe, with another Trumpet, to enquire what was become of the firſt, the Governor deſired M. <hi>de Bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> to come in, which he did, and they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him they would ſurrender, beſeeching him to deſire M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> to ſend Articles, which he thereupon preſently did. In the mean time, M. <hi>de S. Abre,</hi> who was Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant general that day, not to looſe any time, cauſed Faggots to be carried, and way made for the Canon, which he brought forward, and when night drew on, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to open the Trenches, but proceeded not far in them, becauſe the beſiedged ſent back the Articles ſign'd.</p>
                  <p>An hour or two after dinner, a <hi>Fregate</hi> with men to put into <hi>Bommel,</hi> came up the River from <hi>Worcum,</hi> (or <hi>Gorcum</hi>) but having been made more cautious by what happen'd in the morning, we had plac'd a <hi>Corps de Garde</hi> on divers places of the Banks, ſo that they could not paſs, and were forc'd to go back as they came, after having made a diſcharge or two of their Muskets and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non charged with ſmall ſhot. By which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others poor M. <hi>Clodoré</hi> (whom we had occaſion to mention before, for making
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63600:68"/>the Capitulation at <hi>Grave,</hi> and the hiſtory of whoſe life was known to many) was kill'd, one half of his head having been taken off. At length, the Place being yeilded up in the evening, one Monſieur <hi>d'Eſpagne</hi> was made Governor of it the next morning, and there were put into it 4 Companies of <hi>Switzers</hi> and the Regiment <hi>de la Ferté</hi> for a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bommel</hi> is a great Town, ſituate (as we ſaid) on the left bank of the <hi>Wahal,</hi> 3 leagues above <hi>Gorcum;</hi> its ſituation is very advantagious both upon the account of the <hi>Wahal,</hi> which defends one ſide of it, and of the Marſhes which encompaſs it on the other, and which are ſo deep that one can neither undermine nor keep Trenches long open before it. Its Fortifications are likewiſe good, and the Hollander who have made it one of the Keys of their Country, have not forgot to keep them in repair, but made its preſervation one of their cheif cares. It is ſurrounded with good Cortin's, Baſtions and Towers, a double Rampart, and a double ditch. It was beſiedg'd in 1599 for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> by Don <hi>Franceſco de Mendoza</hi> high Admiral of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who after many ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, at laſt vented all his fury upon this Place, which he beſieged with 30000 men, but was notwithſtanding forced after a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night's
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63600:68"/>ſtay to raiſe his Siege. By which we may judge of the ſtrength and conſequence of this Place.</p>
                  <p>The 22, after a Garriſon had been put into <hi>Bommel,</hi> the whole Iſland became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the King, the Forts of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> and of <hi>Wornes</hi> being already poſſeſt by our Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> departed hence with his Army, and came back to <hi>Hempel,</hi> where being to march through the Town he din'd. The Artillery by reaſon of the bad ways having not been able to keep pace with the Army, came behind under the Convoy of the Dragoons. Thoſe who had been drawn out on the 19 to fire the Villages, whoſe Peaſants had beaten and ſo barbarouſly uſed our party, returned after having routed 100 foot and 50 <hi>Maiſtres</hi> of <hi>Breda,</hi> which they met with. Monſieur <hi>de Montauban</hi> was made Governor of <hi>Zutphen,</hi> M. <hi>de Beauvezé</hi> of <hi>Rees,</hi> and M. <hi>de Villiers</hi> of <hi>Doesburg.</hi> This day there arriv'd at <hi>Boxtel</hi> an <hi>Envoye</hi> from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> with many Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a Peace; which made the World think it would at laſt come to ſomething.</p>
                  <p>The 23 after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> had made known his Propoſitions, the King ordered a Drummer to go with him to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> that he might know the Count <hi>de Monterey</hi>'s anſwer to the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:63600:69"/>and the Earl of <hi>Arlington</hi>'s demands in the King of <hi>England</hi>'s name, which was to call back all the Spaniſh Forces that were either in <hi>Breda,</hi> the <hi>Buſſe, Bergen-op Zoom,</hi> or the Dutch Army's. M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> came to wait on his Majeſty at <hi>Boxtel,</hi> and lay there that night following, and his Army the while reſted at <hi>Hompel,</hi> whether the Ordnance being arriv'd with their Convoy, they were ſent on a league forward of the next day's journey towards the Kings Quarters.</p>
                  <p>The 24 the King called a Council of War, at which he himſelf was preſent, as he always uſed to be; and it was there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that after his Majeſty's departure, (who intended to return and refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a while in <hi>France</hi> after the toile he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in the <hi>Campagne</hi>) Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> ſhould ſtay behind in <hi>Brabant</hi> with 20000 men, and ſhould have for his Lieutenants general, the <hi>Sieurs de S. Abre</hi> and <hi>Foucault;</hi> for his Camp-Marſhals the <hi>Sieurs de Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeul, Magalotty,</hi> and <hi>de Vitry;</hi> that the Count <hi>de Chamilly</hi> ſhould come and lye below <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Rochefort</hi> with the greateſt part of the Kings <hi>Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> above it, that ſo betwixt them they might wholly block up that Town; that M. <hi>de la Feuillade</hi> ſhould go with his own Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63600:69"/>and ſome others which he ſhould have given him to the number of 4000 horſe, and lye about <hi>Wezel.</hi> And becauſe the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to return again, as ſoon as he ſhould have given ſuch orders at home as were neceſſary, he ſent moſt part of his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page and heavieſt Baggage to <hi>Grave,</hi> that he might not be troubled to ſend them back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but that at his return he might meet them there in readineſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day the Duke of <hi>Neubourg</hi> came to <hi>Boxtel</hi> to give his Majeſty a viſit, and Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s <hi>Army</hi> leaving <hi>Hempel,</hi> advanc'd towards <hi>Beerlicon</hi> within 2 leagues of the Kings Quarters, and remain'd there till after his Majeſty departure; whom M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> left not till then. At the ſame time the Spaniſh Troops in the Hollanders ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, having heard of the Propoſals which the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> were going to make with Count <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terey,</hi> and knowing that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was not in a condition to maintain a War of that importance as he was thrcaten'd with upon refuſal, pack'd up bag and baggage, and made themſelves ready to depart, upon the firſt orders to that purpoſe, which they doubted not but they ſhould ſpeedily receive. Some perſons whom we met in our march told us they went every day to the <hi>Buſſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:63600:70"/>and aſſur'd us they had ſeen the ſaid Troops there, who were very weary of the ſervice, and complain'd much of their ill diet and pay.</p>
                  <p>The 25, the King after having treated the Duke of <hi>Neubourg,</hi> had him out to view the Troops that belong'd to his perſon, and ſome others that were then with him, and in the evening when he came back, he let us know that he would be going the next morning for <hi>France,</hi> and accordingly gave order that all things ſhould be in a readineſs for his departure againſt that time.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day he committed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Lorraine</hi> to the Marquis <hi>de Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>de Turennes</hi> Army reſted at <hi>Beerlicon,</hi> and the Count <hi>du Lude</hi> Grand-Maſter of the Ordnance left it, and came to <hi>Boxtel</hi> with a part of the Artillery, which was to follow the King. Some few days after, the Marquis <hi>de Ranes</hi> General of the Dragoons, and the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General of the Prince's Army, came thither likewiſe, the King having order'd them to follow him into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 26 in the morning, the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Boxtel,</hi> and came to lye at <hi>Borkel,</hi> which is a great Abbey of white <hi>Fryars</hi> in the way from <hi>Boxtel</hi> to <hi>Tongres.</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:63600:70"/>His Majeſty lodg'd in the Abbey, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Court was forced to encamp about it, becauſe there were very few houſes thereabouts. A great part of the Regiment of <hi>Guards</hi> ſtaid behind, to joyn with M. <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Army, as did all the reſt of the Foot which was in the Kings retinue, becauſe they could not keep pace with the King, who intended thence forwards to take great Journeys; only 12 Companies were order'd to follow ſoftly after him to <hi>Paris.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> return'd to lead his Army, which lay ſtill at <hi>Beerlicon;</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Mechlebourg</hi> came to viſit the King at <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 27 in the morning, the King left <hi>Borkel,</hi> which lies in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and within the Territories that belonged to the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander, and having paſſed by <hi>Beringen,</hi> which is a little Town in <hi>Liege,</hi> went and lodg'd a league beyond that Town.</p>
                  <p>The 28 in the morning, the Light-horſe which had hitherto accompanied the King, returned to joyn with M. <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Army, which had not yet diſencamped; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty came to a little Village called <hi>Leuve,</hi> within a league of <hi>Hannuy,</hi> a little Town of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where we met ſome <hi>Cravates</hi> belonging to the Spaniſh-Troops. The heavy baggage of the Court, and thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63600:71"/>to them, had orders not to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the King any farther, but to march after leiſurely with a Convoy which was ordered for them all. The ſame kind of bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage which belonged to the Kings Houſhold, was ſent to <hi>Maeſiick</hi> with another Convoy. The King in the middle of this day's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney met Monſieur <hi>Vaubrun</hi> with 2000 horſe, a 1000 of which he left with his Majeſty to guard him beyond <hi>Binche,</hi> and returned with the reſt to M. <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Army.</p>
                  <p>The 29 the King left <hi>Leuve</hi> betimes in the morning, and having ſtaid to dine in the middle of his Journy, he was inform'd that all the heavy Baggages had been taken and plundered, ſome ſaid by a party which ſally'd out of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and others by the <hi>Cravates</hi> we met at <hi>Hannuy.</hi> His Majeſty thereupon ſent in haſt to know the certainty of the buſineſs, but the <hi>Courier</hi> brought back word, that only M. <hi>Brancas</hi>'s Baggage had been taken by ſome horſe of the Enemy's who being aware that his Waggoner drove a good way before the reſt, made him turn into the Woods, where they took away the horſes, and left the reſt to be riffled by the Peaſants, who had hid and ſheltered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there ever ſince the beginning of the War.</p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:63600:71"/>
                  <p>The 30 the King, continuing his march, left <hi>Ameley</hi> betimes in the morning, and came by <hi>Binche,</hi> where without entring the Place he dined at the Gate, and afterwards went and lodged a league beyond that Place, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the road of <hi>Queſnoy.</hi> This day he order'd the Van of his Life Guard, and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of the Men at Arms and light Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to go before, and expect him at the Caſtle of <hi>Cambray,</hi> where he intended to ſpend the next day.</p>
                  <p>The 31, the King ſetting out by break of day, arriv'd at <hi>Queſnoy</hi> about 11 of the Clock, where taking only a little broth, he went to bed, and reſted till 5 in the evening, and then after a light repaſt, took Coach, (which he had not done before during all this <hi>Campagne,</hi> but had always travail'd on horſeback whatever weather it was) and rode on all night accompany'd by a ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, which had been drawn out of the Life Guards, Men at Arms, Light Horſemen and Muſqueteers, who accompany'd him to the Caſtle of <hi>Cambray,</hi> where he diſmiſſed them, and made uſe of thoſe he had ſent two days before to expect him there; and ſo march't on with them all the night following. Almoſt all the Court ſtaid at <hi>Queſnoy</hi> to come lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely after, becauſe the King had horſes lay'd for him by the way, and the reſt of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63600:72"/>the horſes that came from the Army were not able to keep pace with them. The Troops that belong'd to the Kings <hi>Houſhold</hi> encamp'd before the Gates of <hi>Queſnoy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the King arriv'd at S. <hi>Quintin</hi> by 4. of the Clock in the morning, heard <hi>Maſs</hi> in the Church of S. <hi>James,</hi> and having taken a little broth, which was brought him from M. <hi>de Pradelle</hi> the Governour of that Town to a Semſtreſſe's Shop, took Coach again and went on to <hi>Ham,</hi> where he left his Convoy, and at length arrived by 10 at night at S. <hi>Germains,</hi> where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>REaders, I grow weary of venting my Wares thus by retail. The reſt are of the ſame kind with the former, but I will give them out to you now in the groſs. They are not deceitfull I can aſſure you: for though I have not been an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs to what I ſhall henceforward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, as I was to all that paſs'd during the Kings ſtay in Holland, yet I have it from ſome of my Friends who ſent me their memoirs, and having no deſign to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform me, took care to write nothing but what they knew for certain truth. And what has confirm'd me in my good opinion of their veracity, is, that I find them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether conformable to the Accounts that were conſtantly brought to Court of what paſs'd in our Armies. You will find here ſome Particulars and Circumſtances, which 'tis likely you have not heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which I promiſe my ſelf you will not be ſorry to know. I wiſh I could have
<pb facs="tcp:63600:74"/>done more both for your Service and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and in requital, deſire you to pardon what you ſhall find amiſs. I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confeſs my weakneſ: and unfitneſs to be an Author. As I never valued my ſelf upon appearing in Print, ſo what I have done now, was only in complaiſance to ſome who deſir'd it.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>OUr invincible Monarch having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently humbled the haughty States, and left a general conſternation all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Country, which made his very name formidable to the ſtouteſt of them, took his way for <hi>France</hi> as we before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
                  <p>His abſence a little rais'd their ſpirits, ſo that they ventur'd out of their Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and march'd towards <hi>Woerden, Croa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nembourg,</hi> and ſom other ſmall Towns, which we had left ungarriſon'd only upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of their Fidelity, not judging it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to beſtow Garriſons on them, that did of neceſſity fall into the Hands of him that was Maſter of the Field. They put ſome Forces into them, and poſſeſs'd them awhile quietly enough, and it may be we ſhould not have concern'd our ſelves ſo far
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63600:75"/>as to drive them out, had not the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> deſign'd to make Incurſions into the liberties of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and to uſe <hi>Woerden</hi> as his retreat. Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg,</hi> who, as we ſaid before, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Army near <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and now permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to reſt and refreſh it ſelf, glad to find an opportunity of doing ſomething for his Kings Service, took the Field, and ſtreight march'd to <hi>Croanembourg,</hi> where (the Horſe upon notice of their deſign, ſecuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a timely retreat) they ſoon made themſelves maſters of the Foot, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much reſiſtance, were made Priſoners of War: and not only they, but 72 more, who intrench'd themſelves in a Caſtle that lay on the way, and for 5 or 6 hours kept our Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons in play, having killed 10 or 12, and broke Monſieur <hi>de Rouvray</hi>'s arm, who commanded our Horſe and the Attaque on one ſide, with a Musket-ſhot. Afterwards the Duke march'd to <hi>Woerden,</hi> which far'd no better then <hi>Croanembourg,</hi> and the Count <hi>de la Mark</hi> was left there with the <hi>Picardy</hi> Regiment.</p>
                  <p>Theſe proceedings did more trouble the States then one can well imagine: for beſides the confuſion it put them in, the loſs of this laſt place, though it be little, and in it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, yet was of great importance
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63600:75"/>to them, becauſe it gave us admiſſion into the heart of their Country, and cut off all communication between divers of their great Towns. So they preſently call'd a Council of War, and very earneſtly deſir'd the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> preſently to beſiege it, who, thinking it a buſineſs of no difficulty, the Town being but ſlenderly fortified, clos'd with the propoſal, not doubting of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it, and reckoning it would do well to fleſh his heart leſs Men; wherefore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently betook himſelf to the march. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was becauſe the Prince had willingly, upon their req<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt, undertaken this buſineſs, or that they did imagine <hi>Woerden</hi> would not be ſo eaſily taken, I know not: but ſo it was, that hereupon they let not their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Protector depart, without beſtowing on him more new Teſtimonies of their Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; wherefore they drew out a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſupply out of their Ships, with which that he might joyn, he went and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at the head of a Paſs between <hi>Weſep</hi> and <hi>Naerden,</hi> where he caus'd a ſtrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment to be rais'd behind a great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale, and placed a guard on it.</p>
                  <p>Such preparations could not be made without the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgs</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for every body talk'd of them; and becauſe it ſeem'd probable, their deſigns

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> towards which their march ſeem'd to incline, he preſently drew out to prevent them.</p>
                  <p>This happened on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> for though they had long known of the Kings return into <hi>France,</hi> yet were they 2 or 3 months before they could ſo recollect their ſpirits as to think upon attempting any thing. The Duke therefore by 4 in the morning, leading with him 4000 Foot, and all his Horſe, went and took up his poſt near the Paſs through which the whole Dutch Army was to march; but this he did ſo ſuddenly, that he ſurprized them; ſo that their Van-guard, without ſtaying to diſcover who we were, betook themſelves to their heels with as much haſt as if they had been already beaten, which gave our Van-guard occaſion to laugh at them ſufficiently: yet with all their haſte they could not eſcape ſome of our Dragoons, who flung them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Cannel, which ſerv'd them as a Baricado, and ſwimming over killed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, and took 40 Priſoners juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Intrenchment within which the whole Body of their Army lay, not one of them daring to ſtir out to bring off their Companions; only they let fly ſome Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of Shot from their Canon, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63600:76"/>which, our Men encamped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there.</p>
                  <p>The next day being the ninth, our Army, which had purpoſely taken this poſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their motions, was very intent all day upon that, and getting together ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, without enterpriſing any thing elſe: But the Hollanders lay not ſo quiet as we, for they had been too long upon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive part already, and therefore reſolv'd now to enter upon the offenſive; 20 or 30 of their braveſt Fellows ſeeing us lie ſtill, had a great mind to take our Forragers, who were as ſecurely at their work, as if they had been at the Gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> not thinking any body would dare to come and diſturb them. This their confidence gave the Enemy the better opportunity, who thereupon encloſed both the Men, Horſes and Forrage. The truth is, the Sieur <hi>de la Rouillardiere,</hi> Captain of a Company of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and the Sieur <hi>Vieuxpont</hi> his Cornet, had been order'd to be their Convoy; but becauſe the extent of the Country, which they were to defend, was ſomewhat large, they had divided themſelves, each taking 15 <hi>Maiſtres</hi> which they commanded; ſo that they could not hinder the Enemies deſign, neither did they oppoſe it, but ſuffer'd all to be taken. Yet the Hollander had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:63600:78"/>to brag of the Exploit; for our Captain and his Cornet, inſtead of coming towards them, left them maſters of the Field awhile, and wheeling a little about, joyn'd, and took up their poſt in a narrow paſſage, by which they ſaw the Enemy muſt come with his prize, and there waited for them; where, after having ſtood their firſt diſcharge, they made them all Priſoners, not one eſcaping, and brought them, and all the Forragers, back to our Camp. In the Evening, the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> gave order to his Men to be ready by the next Morning, reſolving, ſeeing they ſtirr'd not, to approach them nearer, and try if he could entice them out: and at the ſame time order'd a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain of the <hi>Piedmont</hi> Regiment, with 12 Granadiers, to go and attaque them within their Barricado, and try if any of them ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed out, to take ſome Priſoners, whilſt he would be ready, in caſe of need, to bring them off. The Captain perform'd what he was commanded very couragiouſly, paſt their firſt Barricado without any reſiſtance, and march'd on to the ſecond, where he found as little oppoſition; and ſeeing nothing but Men that fled, he advanc'd to the third, which chanc'd to be a Houſe, ſo he ſet fire on that, and went on with intent to take ſome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners if he could, as he had been ordered,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63600:78"/>but he loſt his labor; for the Dutchmen, notwithſtanding their purſie fat bulk, plyed their legs ſo nimbly at this time, that it was not poſſible for him to overtake one. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he return'd, and being to give account of what he had done, told the Duke, He had forc'd &amp; fired their Barricado's, and ran after the Enemy, but without being able to catch any, becauſe they flew, fear having put wings to their feet. The truth is, they never left running till they came to <hi>Boden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> ſo that M. <hi>de Luxembourg</hi> finding there was likely to be no more action, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> where he was not long idle; for the Hollanders prepared more Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels for him, as you ſhall hear.</p>
                  <p>The tenth in the Morning they ſet forward, and embarking upon the River to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 14000, came and took up their poſt before <hi>Woerden,</hi> which the Prince caus'd preſently to be block'd up, hoping to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the Garriſon, who indeed had no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their coming; but they not having been negligent in their duties, the buſineſs was not likely to be effected ſo ſoon as the Enemy hop'd, who now began to fear this little paltry Town would coſt them more then they imagined, wherefore they ſpent the reſt of this, and all the following day, in Intrenching themſelves, and fortifying all
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63600:79"/>the Avenues to their Camp, eſpecially that part of it which lay towards <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining if any ſuccors came to the Town, it it would be from thence. In the mean time, the Count <hi>de la Mark</hi> took care to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> and not doubting but he would ſpeedily come to his aſſiſtance, was ſtill upon the watch, ready to ſally forth and ſet upon the Enemy on his ſide, as ſoon as he ſhould find ſome ſuccors come to ſecond him.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Intelligence, which came in a very ill time (becauſe the Duke of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> was then in the Field with ſo ſmall a party as could not be able to attempt any thing of themſelves, any one but he would have been ſufficiently puzled; but it was not then a time to ſtand conſidering, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commanded thoſe that were with him to march on toward the beſieged place, whilſt he went poſt to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> where he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Marquis of <hi>Genlis</hi> to take all the Horſe he had, and ſome Foot, and follow after with all poſſible ſpeed, ordering 2000 which were then ready to march immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, becauſe the danger being great requir'd a like remedy. Theſe Orders were given moſt prudently, and if they were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly executed, I can give no reaſon for it; but this I can certainly affirm, That the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63600:79"/>Duke, being impatient till he got to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, left all theſe Forces to be brought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Monſieur <hi>de Genlis,</hi> and put himſelf at the head of thoſe he had ſent before, when he firſt receiv'd the news of the Siege; and the other 2000 Foot which he found ready, reſolving with this ſmall party to ſet upon the Enemy, and venture all, rather then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the place to be loſt ſo under his noſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever attempting any thing to ſave it.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd that this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was ſtrangely hazardous, and the happy iſſue of it beyond belief. For it ſeem'd morally impoſſible, that our party ſhould ſwim over a River, and the Cauſeys being as good for the Hollander as ſo many Rampires and Gabions; that they ſhould rout an Army ten times as numerous as their own, and win a Fort from them furniſhed with five Intrenchments well flank'd and pallizado'd. Yet notwithſtanding all this, the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> having ſtaid a little for Monſieur <hi>de Genlis,</hi> and as long as was convenient to prepare himſelf for an attaque, began to ſet on the Enemy, who in ſpite of all his courage, and theirs that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beat him twice back; but at the third Onſet, the Marquis <hi>de Meilly</hi> gave the reſt a good example, by leaping into the Water up to his middle, which made many Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63600:80"/>and Voluntiers, and at laſt the whole party to do the like, and ſo they paſſed over upon the very mouthes of the Enemies Guns, and got within their Intrenchments, which they were glad to quit and betake themſelves to ſlight, as their laſt and beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>de la Mark</hi> in the mean while, who as I ſaid before, was ſtill ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Enemy if he had aſſaulted the place, or to ſally out, if he ſaw any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of being aſſiſted, being aware of the Duke of <hi>Luxembourgs</hi> arrival and attaque, loſt no time, but ſallyed out in perſon, and fell in amongſt them like Lightning, killing many with his own hand, and being very well ſeconded by thoſe that followed him, who had before tryed the Enemies Courage in a Sally that 400 of them made at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Siege, in which, driving the Enemy out of a part of the Suburbs where they had ſheltred themſelves, the better to make their approaches, they fired it, and beat the Enemy out of three Intrenchments which they had made to hinder any ſallies from the Town. The M. of <hi>Bois Dauphin</hi> was killed in this firſt action, with ſix other Soldiers. So all their Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Banks, Canales, Sluces, Forts and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63600:80"/>Redouts, wherewith they had fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all their Canon, were obſtacles too weak to keep us out, for they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently quite routed, and the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> himſelf was forc'd to put all hopes of ſafety in the fleetneſs of his Horſe. But he was fortunate enough, not to be of the number of about 500 who were taken, and 800 ſlain; amongſt which were the Sieur <hi>Zuleſtein,</hi> who had been Tutor to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Bis</hi> his Steward; with 2 other Colonels, 3 Lieutenants, and about 70 or 80 Officers, beſides a great many that were drown'd, and whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber could not be certainly known, but may be gueſt at by thoſe who were ſince taken up at divers places; which among the reſt, amounted to 50 in one little Canale.</p>
                  <p>Their flight was too ſudden for them to think of any thing but ſaving their lives, wherefore all their Baggage and Canon, which were nine Pieces, three of which were on Batteries againſt the Town, and the reſt within their Intrenchments, againſt any ſuccor that might come to relieve it, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hands. Theſe were all put into the Town, and will be made uſe of to repulſe the Enemy again, if they dare ever attempt any thing againſt it.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:63600:81"/>
                  <p>As there are no Roſes without Prickles, nor great Pleaſures, which have not either accompanying or ſoon following them ſome alloy of ſorrow, ſo this ſtrangely fortunate ſucceſs, could not be attain'd without ſome loſs of our ſide. We loſt in the Action ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soldiers, and among the Perſons of Note were the Count <hi>de Meilly,</hi> the Colonel to the <hi>Normandy</hi> Regiment, and who commanded the Foot in this Service, the Sieur <hi>de la Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hays</hi> his Lieutenant, a Gentleman of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Parville Tibout,</hi> a Voluntier of <hi>Normandy</hi> likewiſe, in the ſame Body. The M. <hi>de la Meylleraye,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of the <hi>Piedmont</hi> Regiment. M. <hi>de Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diniere,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel of the <hi>Navarre</hi> Regiment, and the Chevalier <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> Colonel of the Regiment <hi>Royal</hi> of Dragoons were dangerouſly wounded; beſides divers Voluntiers who did wonders.</p>
                  <p>As the ſucceſs of ſo perillous an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe could not but be very glorious to the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> ſo upon that account it did reward it ſelf; but neither prov'd it leſs advantagious to him, then glorious. For the generous Monarch, for whoſe ſervice it had been undertook, no ſooner heard of it, but with many Commendations beſtow'd on him, He preſently thought how he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe it; and beſides a great ſum of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63600:81"/>mony, ſent the Duke a Commiſſion to be Captain of his Guards, in the ſtead of the Marquis <hi>de Lauzun Peguilain,</hi> that he and all Men might thereby ſee, That no Man ſerves him for nothing, That whatever is done for him, is preſently follow'd by its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence; and, That he better knows how to reward Virtue then puniſh Vice.</p>
                  <p>This firſt Eſſay of the Hollanders, for the execution of which they had taken all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble care, and done all that might aſſure them of a good event, ſucceeding ſo ill, was not however altogether uſeleſs to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> who being made more cautious by his ill ſucceſs, reſolv'd from henceforward not to venture any thing, nor make the leaſt attempt where he was ſure to find any great oppoſition. The States likewiſe began to diſcover how unſeaſonably they had put him upon this Siege. Wherefore, that he might not be forc'd to be always doing nothing, to which he was here reduc'd by the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who was ſtill at the heels of him, as ſoon as he took the Field. He thought he might do ſomthing to more purpoſe, if leaving Holland he went toward <hi>Liege,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt <hi>Tongres</hi> or <hi>Fouquemont,</hi> which were neither fortified, nor like to be ſuccor'd by any Army that lay near them: for M. <hi>de Turenne</hi> was march'd after the Imperial and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63600:82"/>
                     <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Forces, or elſe againſt <hi>Maeſiick,</hi> whoſe Fortifications not being yet finiſh'd, would more eaſily be taken. In this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution he choſe out his beſt Troops, and moſt experienc'd Commanders, in whom he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confided, and made up a Body of about 14000 or 15000 Men. And thus having given all neceſſary Orders for the ſecurity of his Camp at <hi>Bodengrave,</hi> (which had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been his retiring place in all his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and which having been fortifying it all the Summer, he had made a Bulwark for the ſecurity of all the reſt of <hi>Holland</hi>) he ſet forward by the ways of <hi>Worcum, Gorcum,</hi> and <hi>Breda,</hi> deſigning to take with him a part of the Garriſon of this laſt nam'd Town, as well as thoſe of the <hi>Buſſe, Berguen-op-Zoom,</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> to augment his Army; but did not execute what he intended, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he chang'd his mind, or becauſe he could not, the Garriſons of thoſe places being for the moſt part Spaniards. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were, it matters not, but <hi>Bommelle</hi> lying in his way, and that being a great rich Town, and one of the chief of thoſe that lie on the <hi>Wahal,</hi> he thought it would be no bad prize if he could compaſs it, and would be a happy beginning of his intended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; wherefore he march'd thither, and began to make his approaches; but going
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63600:82"/>in Perſon to view it, he chanc'd to bleed at the Noſe; which ſeeming ominous, he would not obſtinatly ſtay any longer before it, but march'd ſtraight on to <hi>Tongres,</hi> with deſign to ſet upon that. But the Sieur <hi>Montal,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> having had Orders from the King, who had intelligence of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to put ſome Soldiers into it; having done accordingly, ſpoil'd their deſign. <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiick</hi> would have been a better bit for them, but they were too dainty to ſtoop to ſuch courſe fair, and therefore went on towards <hi>Fouquemont,</hi> upon which the Prince vented all his fury, and took it with as much greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as it had been defended generouſly, by the Lieutenant Colonel of the <hi>Jonzac.</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who was in it only with 200 Men, endur'd four Aſſaults very bravely, but at laſt was forc'd to yield it up. After this, the Prince reſum'd his deſign againſt <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres,</hi> and march'd towards it; but let us leave him awhile to ſee what was done in the mean time in his own Country.</p>
                  <p>The Hollander had not ſo much reaſon to rejoyce at the taking of <hi>Fouquemont,</hi> as they had of being ſorrowful at the ſucceſs of our Arms, and thoſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Munſters</hi> in <hi>Friſeland.</hi> The Count <hi>de Saulx,</hi> having been told by a certain Captain in his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who had learn'd it from ſome German

Hereupon the Count <hi>de Saulx</hi> received the Order which he had deſir'd of marching thither; he had given him to that end 300 Men of his own Regiment, and 200 out of that of <hi>Caſtelnau,</hi> 50 Dragoons, and as many Horſe, with Commiſſion only to take all the party that were guarding that paſſage, and not to venture, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt in going to the Enemies Quarters.</p>
                  <p>The 15 of <hi>November</hi> was the day which confer'd on him the glory he gain'd in this enterprize. He ſet out about 3 of the clock after dinner, having at leaſt 100 Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mades
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63600:84"/>Officers that follow'd him as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers; and the firſt thing he did, was to ſend a Captain of his Regiment to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſecure the Avenues, that no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might be given to the Enemy of the march. But he was but juſt got beyond a place called <hi>Lexmende</hi> when he ſaw the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain return, who brought word, That the Enemy had certainly ſmelt the Deſign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſince they were ſent, the number of the party was encreas'd, and they had made up a Barriere before their Intrenchment, where they had plac'd ſome of their new comers, whom he had ſeen reliev'd by others, and that the outward Guard ſeem'd to conſiſt of about 10 Men.</p>
                  <p>This news encreas'd the joy of our brave Commander, who now ſaw, that though he was confin'd to do nothing but carry away all that guarded that place, yet he now ſhould carry away at leaſt twice as many; and that if he afterwards march'd on to the Enemies Quarters (as he intended) he ſhould with more eaſe maſter them, ſince they had weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves by ſending this party to the others aſſiſtance. Wherefore he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Captain, with his Company, to take only their Swords and leave their Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms behind, that ſo they might, if poſſible, make the other party yield without noiſe,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63600:85"/>leaſt the Alarm ſhould be thereby given to the Enemies main Quarters. This was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well contriv'd, but the party proving to be Horſe (which he knew not of his Scouts, who ſaw none of their Horſes) ſome of them gave notice to the reſt time enough for them (who had receiv'd very conſiderable ſuccors upon the intelligence they receiv'd 2 hours before of the Deſign) to prepare themſelves to receive us.</p>
                  <p>So great an alteration was enough to have ſent the Count back as he came, but it did only heighten his courage, who thought himſelf now too far ingag'd to leave off ſo, wherefore ſeeing all his men deſiring nothing more then to engage, he continued his march, and within a little while came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Piſtol-ſhot of the Intrenchment. There were two ways which led to it, and gave him an opportunity to attaque it in two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once, but one of them was hardly paſſable upon the account of a Sluce five or ſix foot deep; yet notwithſtanding he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to make uſe of them both, and to that purpoſe mended the other a little firſt, and then immediatly commanded the Grenadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to advance and cut down the Palliſados; but they not being able to perform it, becauſe of their thickneſs, he commanded the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to climb over, which ſucceeded ſo well,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63600:85"/>that the Enemies, after a ſhort reſiſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to flight, and gain'd their Quarters where they ſtaid not long; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves purſued, they ſtole away without any noiſe of Drum or Trumpet, though they were 1000 or 1200 Men.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that as the Enemies were always very vigorouſly ſet upon, ſo was their Cowardize extraordinary, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it had not been poſſible 1200 Men ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be routed and beaten out of a Fort, which on one ſide was ſtrengthned by a great Canale that ran at the foot of it, and on the other by two rows of ſtrong Palliſado's 7 Foot high, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapet Canon proof, 8 foot high, with two pieces of Ordnance, which they had plac'd there upon notice of our Deſign; beſides 3 Fregats upon the Canale, who with their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non were to defend the Intrenchment.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis of <hi>Caſtlenaw,</hi> who was one of the Voluntiers, after having kill'd three with his own hand, in the heat of the Action had his hand lifted up to have done as much to a fourth, but was prevented by a Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, which ſo ſhatter'd his Arm, that it was fain to be cut off; and afterwards, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Chirurgions care, gangrend, ſo that he dyed of it ſome days after at <hi>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63600:86"/>of the moſt couragious and brave Men we had: but his death was ſoon reveng'd by that of him that had ſhot him, and 50 of his Companions, which were killed on the place, and 100 more who were taken: the Fire deſtroying the reſt of them.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day being the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, the Marquis <hi>de Mouſſis,</hi> Colonel of the <hi>Queens</hi> Regiment, having been order'd to go and beat up a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Enemy Quarter'd near <hi>Weſep,</hi> went accordingly with 300 Men, drawn out of the Garriſon of <hi>Naerden;</hi> but he found no body, for they had retir'd upon notice of his march, ſo they fired the Village which they had quitted.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time the Enemy took a fanſie to attaque a place in <hi>Frizeland,</hi> whether they went with 5000 Horſe and 300 Foot, and not having been able to ſurprize it as they hop'd, they laid ſo formal a Siege to it, that it laſted too long to their misfortune. For the Marquis <hi>Reinel,</hi> Camp-maſter to a party of Horſe of the Confederate Forces, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, got together all the Men he could in haſt, and went to its relief, where he broke through their Lines, getting into the Camp among them, killed many, routed the reſt, and gain'd all their baggage.</p>
                  <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, had no better fortune then they, or
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63600:86"/>the Imperialiſts that he had with him.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>de Sainfandaux</hi> at this time Fora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging about the Country with 20 or 25 <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres,</hi> was betraid by a Peaſant who was his Guide, into the Hands of a party of theirs, conſiſting of 800, where after a long and brave reſiſtance, he was at length over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd by numbers, wounded, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away Priſoner. This was done before any Declaration of War from that Elector, but this act of Hoſtility was not long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reprizals. Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> hearing they had left 100 Horſe for the Guard of the Bridge, by which they had paſs'd over the <hi>Main,</hi> ſent 150 <hi>Maiſtres</hi> of the Kings houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, under the command of Monſieur <hi>Brizac,</hi> Lieutenant of the Life-guards, to take cognizance of them, and diſcover whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what had been done was out of ſome particular grudge to M. <hi>Saintſandoux,</hi> or that they intended an open War. He went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and having found the Bridge guarded as he had been informed, advanc'd towards the Commander in chief, and after having ask'd who they were for, demanded free paſſage, which was granted him: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he demanded Quarters in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring Houſes, whereupon the Officer told him, That being there was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient room to quarter both parties in,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63600:87"/>there was no reaſon he who had firſt taken up the Quarters ſhould be turn'd out of them; this ſatisfied him as to that point, he having no deſign to quarter there, wherefore M. <hi>Brizac</hi> ask'd him if he would ſend for ſome Wine, ſaying, They muſt needs drink a Bottle together: but the German ſmelling a deſign of making him ſpeak more in his drink then he was minded to do now he was ſober, replyed, He had already drunk his Mornings draught; and that if they muſt needs drink to one another, it muſt be at a diſtance: whereupon Monſieur <hi>de Brizac</hi> commanded his Men to advance, ſaying, Why then you are not our Friends? and ſo ſell on and defeated them. A part of whom were kill'd in the Encounter, and the reſt were either taken, or ſaved themſelves by flight, ſo that our Men became maſters of the Bridge; but Monſieur <hi>Brizac</hi> having had no order to keep it, came back with his party.</p>
                  <p>The keeping of this Bridge was of main conſequence to the Duke of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> both upon the account of his Intereſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: it being the way by which he was to retire, in caſe of ill ſucceſs; and he having bragg'd and promis'd he would maintain it. Wherefore, having been told by thoſe who had fled, that they had been defeated by one
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63600:87"/>only Squadron, imagining we ſhould have kept the ſame poſt, he ſent 2000 Men to take it from us; but we ſaved them a labor, becauſe we thought it not worth keeping. But it ſeems they were not of our mind, for thoſe 2000 Men ſtrongly entrenched themſelves at the end of the Bridge, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrong guard there, diſpos'd of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as they could in the Quarters thereabout, but with order to be ever upon their guard, becauſe they foreſaw that as long as Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> lay ſo near them, he would not fail frequently to viſit them.</p>
                  <p>They were not out in their conjectures, for Monſieur <hi>Turenne</hi> having had notice of their being his neighbors, two days after their return thither, and imagining they were come thither with a deſign not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the place without engaging, took with him the Kings Houſhold, and march'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them with all ſpeed, to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of them himſelf, being reſolv'd once more to beat them from that poſt.</p>
                  <p>He had not march'd far, when being yet above three quarters of a mile ſhort of the Bridge, paſſing thorow a Wood he met the Count <hi>d'Onak,</hi> a near Kinſman to the Duke of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> who being out upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of getting intelligence, hearing ſome Dogs which had follow'd our party, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63600:88"/>were hunting in the Wood, he follow'd the Cry till he came near our Van-guard, and hearing a noiſe of Men and Horſes, came on towards us, but found other kind of Hunters then he was aware of, for he ſoon perceived they were our Troops by their marching in rank and file; he came up to us notwithſtanding very reſolutly, and having ask'd who we were for, let fly at us firſt; who returning the ſame ſalute, wounded him in five or ſix places, whereof he dyed on the place curſing and ſwearing: part of his followers, which were 15 or 16 in all, were taken Priſoners, and the reſt fled to the Bridge, where they put the whole party in ſuch a fright, that M. <hi>Turenne</hi> at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val found it deſerted.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the worthy Exploits the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander and their Partizans perform'd at home, whilſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> rang'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> with intent to ſurprize ſome place on that ſide. He went to ſet upon <hi>Liege</hi> it ſelf, but ſtaid not long before it: but becauſe <hi>Tongres,</hi> and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon there had done him much miſchief, he had a great ſpight at it, and was alway fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſome deſign againſt it. After the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Fouquemont,</hi> he reſolv'd to beſiege it in good earneſt; and it was in his march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it that we left him but now, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:63600:88"/>we will now purſue our diſcourſe of him, and ſee how his deſign ſped. But if we would have found him before the Place, we muſt have return'd ſooner, for though he came thither with intent to ſit down before it, yet Count <hi>Marſin</hi> made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject miſcarry, who (ſeing though the Place was not over well fortified, yet the Garriſon in it was very ſtrong, and might defend themſelves very long, and coſt a great many lives to winn it, M. <hi>de Montal</hi> being in the Place, who doubtleſs would maintain it to the laſt), adviſed him not to purſue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any farther.</p>
                  <p>This advice which was well grounded, ſuggeſted to them another more likely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the iſſue of which would be of much more conſequence. Monſieur <hi>Montal</hi> being now in <hi>Tongres,</hi> whether he was come and had brought with him a great party of men to reinforce the Garriſon, made them judge <hi>Charleroy,</hi> whoſe Governour he was, and out of which he had drawn thoſe men, might eaſily be gained, both upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Governours abſence, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Garriſon, which they imagin'd was much weakened by the party that M. <hi>de Montal</hi> had thence carried with him to <hi>Tongres:</hi> upon theſe grounds, they reſolv'd to beſiege it, and gave Count <hi>Monterey</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:63600:89"/>notice of their deſign, to oblige him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the importance of the Place, to ſend them more Forces; which, it ſeems, he too carefully and zealouſly did. For he unfurniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many of his Towns to make up a body of 16000, which was directly contrary to the Treaty at the <hi>Pyrenaeans</hi> and <hi>Aix la Chappelle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 15 of <hi>December</hi> the Count <hi>Marſin,</hi> who commanded that Body, went and ſat down before the Place in expectation of the Prince who was to follow with his Army.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Sieur <hi>de Montal</hi> being inform'd of the deſign by ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and by 50 <hi>Maiſtres,</hi> whom he had ordered to follow the Enemy at a diſtance and obſerve their motions, (though he could hardly beleive they would venture upon ſo great and difficult a buſineſs) yet ſent intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of it to the Court (as they alſo did from <hi>Charleroy</hi>) withal deſiring a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to return, and get into the Town; which he immediatly prepared himſelf to do, without ſtaying for orders, ſo ſoon as he ſhould be ſure they were reſolved upon the Siege of that Place.</p>
                  <p>The 16 Monſieur de <hi>S. Cla</hi> a Brigadier of Horſe, hearing of the ſame deſign at <hi>Maeſiick</hi> where he then was, went thence accompanied by the <hi>Sieurs de S. Sylveſtre,</hi> and <hi>d'Arty</hi> Captains of Horſe, the <hi>Sieurs
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63600:89"/>de Labadie, Vignart, de Treüil</hi> Lieutenants <hi>Levigny</hi> and <hi>Magny</hi> Cornets, and <hi>Lopair</hi> and <hi>Empereur</hi> Quarter-Maſters, together with 50 other Horſe, and brought the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this news to M. <hi>de Montal</hi> at <hi>Tongres,</hi> offering him withal, to accompany him in his deſign of getting back into the Town; he accepted their profer, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther delay, diſpos'd himſelf to ſet forward the next morning.</p>
                  <p>The 17 he ſet out about 10 in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he had appointed, accompanied by the forementioned Gentlemen and their 50 <hi>Maiſtres,</hi> beſides 60 more which he had brought along with him to <hi>Tongres,</hi> and marched all day and all night, intending to get thither the next day, whatever it coſt them. In the mean time, the <hi>Couriers,</hi> who had been ſent with the news, making all poſſible ſpeed, arriv'd all three one after another to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> were their Majeſties then were.</p>
                  <p>The news they brought, was ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and it ſeem'd ſo improbable that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſhould come into <hi>Fland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> to beſiege one of our principal Places there, that had not all the 3 Couriers ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively confirmed what had been related, of the Count <hi>Monterey</hi>'s drawing out 15000 or 1600 men out of his Garriſons, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63600:90"/>ſending them to begin the Siege, the <hi>Couriers</hi> would have been laught at as mad men, rather then beleiv'd; beſides that after all, there was another reaſon that added to the improbability of it, which was the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Treaty, which after this Count <hi>Monterey</hi> could not excuſe. They were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding beleived, becauſe they all ſaid the ſame thing, and the King thereupon that ſame night ſent the Marquis of <hi>Louvois</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in poſt, and ſent orders to the Marſhal <hi>d'Humieres,</hi> who was at his own eſtate near <hi>Compiegne</hi> to go immediatly to <hi>Liſle,</hi> of which he was Governour, and there to expect farther orders. As M. <hi>de Louvoys</hi> is a man of excellent conduct and foreſight in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging buſineſs, ſo is he indefatigable when their is need of diſpatch, he therefore ſet out at midnight as ſoon as he had his orders, and having ſent to the Chevalier <hi>de Nogent</hi> to accompany him, went by <hi>Peronne,</hi> and thence to <hi>Athe.</hi> The Marſhal <hi>d'Humieres</hi> likewiſe though he had kept his bed three days before, being tormented by the Colick, ſet out immediatly for <hi>Liſle.</hi> As to Monſieur <hi>de Montal,</hi> he took the ſame way along the Cauſſey, by which the Enemy had march'd before him, that ſo he might not be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: he had not marched above 5 or 6 hours, before he overtook ſome of the rear
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63600:90"/>of their Army loitering behind, all which he ſtrip'd and hamme-ſtring'd their horſes, that they might not follow nor give notice of his march.</p>

                  <p>All this was don in the night, and at day break he arrived within ſight of their Camp, but there made a halt, not being willing to appear till their guards were releiv'd, leaſt when he would have forced his paſſage, all the whole Army ſhould be upon his back, which ſucceeded as he could have wiſh'd.</p>
                  <p>The firſt body of Men he came at, after coming out of the Woods, was a Regiment of Spaniſh foot, amongſt whom he intruded ſo far, before they were aware of it, that though they began to ſuſpect him, yet they dared not give the Alarm, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſaluted him civilly, and he returned them the like.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:63600:91"/>
                  <p>If Monſieur <hi>de Montal</hi> had found all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> of the ſame oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and civil temper, he would certainly have ever after commended their good breeding, and found no uſe for the ſwords which he and all his party carried ready drawn under their cloakes. But that would not be, for as he came near a Glaſs-houſe where a great many were quartered, as well as in all the out-houſes thereabouts, ſome body having ſpied their naked ſwords, cryed to Arms, ſaying they were Enemies, and thereupon they ſhot at them from every part, becauſe they ſtill marched on, not minding what was don; but by this time the Alarm was every where ſpread, and it was time for our men to think of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which they did ſo much the more eaſily becauſe the Enemies Horſe-guard, which conſiſted of 150 <hi>Maiſtres,</hi> and were poſted between the Town and Camp had newly unbridled their horſes, ſo that not above 70 or 80 were found ready, who came upon us and were moſt of them killed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom was he that lead them call'd <hi>Floris Major,</hi> who was in great repute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. 13 or 14 of our party were either killed or taken, whom we ſtaid not to releive, leaſt by ſo doing we ſhould have loſt the favorable opportunity of getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <hi>Charleroy,</hi> for if we had obſtinatly ſtaid to diſengage them, it may be the whole Army had fall'n upon us. We therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gain'd the Town, in number 100 horſe, beſides the Officers, and got into it on <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> ſide, where at our coming M. <hi>de Montal</hi> found every one doing their duty, and very watchful againſt any thing the Enemy ſhould attempt.</p>
                  <p>The Place was cloſe beſet by the Enemy, who lay within Carrabine ſhot of it, yet without attemting any thing upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works: The truth is M. <hi>de Franclieu,</hi> the Kings Lieutenant in that Place, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in cheif during the Governors ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, had done every thing that was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and applied all imaginable diligence, to put all things in the beſt poſture that could be, in caſe they ſhould be attaqu'd. Monſieur <hi>Desbonnais,</hi> a Brigadier of foot, who by good chance had ſtaid there, did likewiſe much contribute to it, as did the <hi>Sieur Terrade,</hi> an Engineer, who took on him the care of the works: ſo that every body ſtrove who ſhould ſhew moſt zeal for his Majeſty's and their Country's ſervice, there being no body who deſerv'd not much commendation on this occaſion.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as Monſieur <hi>de Montal</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived he took care that all things ſhould be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63600:92"/>ordered to the beſt advantage, and finding that the party of horſe which he had brought with him, might be very ſerviceable to him againſt the Enemy, and likewiſe very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the Place if their Forrage began to fail, he ſent out 50 of them to defend 150 Musketeers, commanded by the <hi>Sieur Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonnais,</hi> whilſt they ſhould get together all the Forrage they could find all along the <hi>Sambre,</hi> in the moſt remote houſes, this was 3 houres doing, and had been ſooner perform'd had not the Enemy ſtrove to oppoſe it, and ſo hinder'd our men from returning ſo ſoon as otherwiſe they might. And yet we loſt nothing by the bargain, for our men beat the Enemy on this occaſion from a Poſt which they kept with a conſiderable guard of horſe and foot, and killed many of them, we looſing but 2 Soldiers in all the Action.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt all this went on ſo gloriouſly, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body was ſeveraly employed in the Town, M. <hi>de Montal</hi> betook himſelf to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the deſigns of the Enemy, and having obſerved a Battery which they were raiſing upon a riſing ground that lay before the two little ponds, where the works chanced no to be coated, nor quite finiſh'd; he judg'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Now Monſieur <hi>de Franclieu,</hi> having before foreſeen how the buſineſs would go, had drawn a traverſe acroſſe the whole length, which though it was not yet quite perfected, yet was forward enough, to be capable of ſheltering thoſe Soldiers, which M. <hi>de Montal</hi> immediately commanded to be placed there, together with ſome horſe which were ordered to take up their ſtation in the ditch, which was not fenc'd with Palliſados, that they might have the freer paſſage in and out.

                  <p>But the Enemy, who by this time diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from their Camp, which lay very near, that they ſhould not eaſily carry the Place, began to flinch, and abate much of their fury; ſo that the night following, inſtead of aſſaulting the Town, as they ought to have done, they diſcontinued their Battery, ſo that on the 19 in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

This ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63600:93"/>according to his wiſh, and indeed all was ordered with admirable courage and conduct.

                  <p>They came near enough to receive a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute of ſmall ſhot from a ſmall party of

                  <p>All this while our indefatigable King, whom neither the time of the year, nor the ill weather, nor any other difficulty could ever fright, being accuſtomed to expoſe himſelf to as many dangers as if he were a private perſon, reſolved to go himſelf to provide for the defence of the Place, and the Queen being ſenſible how impatient ſhe ſhould be of his abſence, if ſhe could not conſtantly hear from him, reſolved to go as far as <hi>Compiegne,</hi> that ſhe might be nearer him; ſo their Majeſties the ſame day left <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and went to <hi>S.

                  <p>All this while Monſieur <hi>de Montal</hi> not knowing of their deſign, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had ready great numbers of Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and wool packs, and 2000 Barrels, beſides all other neceſſary's for making an aſſault, kept all night on the Guard, and lin'd the Counter ſcarps as thick as he could, that they might be well defended.</p>
                  <p>The 21 their Majeſties continuing in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63600:94"/>their firſt deſign, the King for <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and the Queen for <hi>Compeigne,</hi> left St. <hi>Germain</hi> in <hi>Laye,</hi> and went and lay at the <hi>Louvre</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Montal,</hi> who had all the night been upon the Watch, expecting that the Enemy ſhould attaque his Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, or open their Trenches, was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in his expectation; for betimes in the morning, Count <hi>Marſin</hi> ſent away all his Wool-packs, Baskets, and Sacks to put Earth in, together with twenty pieces of Canon, and two Morter-pieces, to be carryed back to <hi>Namur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 22. their Majeſties went and lay at <hi>Verberye,</hi> which is a great Village almoſt in the mid way between <hi>Senles</hi> and <hi>Compeigne.</hi> At laſt the Enemies rais'd their Siege, and about day-break all their Troops, both Dutch and Spaniſh, diſcamp'd and march'd off; the Hollanders going by the ways of <hi>Marchienes-au-pont,</hi> and <hi>Fontaine-l'Eveſque</hi> towards <hi>Binche,</hi> which they attaqu'd as they came from the Siege of <hi>Charleroy;</hi> and the Spaniards towards ..... where the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Count <hi>Marſin,</hi> and ſome other Generals met, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards march'd towards <hi>Rennel, Viennotte,</hi> and other places, and then departed every one to their ſeveral Quarters: and among
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63600:95"/>the reſt, Fifteen hundred Foot, and ſome Horſe, which had been drawn out of <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,</hi> return'd thither.</p>
                  <p>The 23. Their Majeſties arriv'd at <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piegne,</hi> which the King intended to leave and paſs on further, according as he ſhould hear from the Courriers; but thoſe who arriv'd that night, bringing news of the Enemies retreat, made him change his mind; but being likewiſe told of the Hollanders ſitting down before <hi>Binche,</hi> he reſolved to ſtay there till he could further ſee into their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
                  <p>The 24, 25, and 26, their Majeſties reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Compiegne,</hi> and talk'd not of ſtirring thence, becauſe of the return of the Dutch Forces to <hi>Binche;</hi> their Majeſties were not willing to go back thence, till the Dutch were retir'd from before that place, which at laſt they did, after having beat down the Gates of it as a mark of their fury.</p>
                  <p>The 27, whilſt the Hollanders venter'd their laſt ſtake before <hi>Binche,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> left <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>treeht,</hi> taking with him Two thouſand Horſe, and all the Foot he could make, and went to <hi>Woerden,</hi> where he would not ſtay, but made his Men march on
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63600:95"/>all night, intending to ſet upon <hi>Bodengrave,</hi> which was the Hollanders refuge, to which they us'd to retire, when ever they had ill ſucceſs, as to an aſſur'd place of ſafety. So that the next day, in ſpight of the Thaw, the Snow, the Bogs, and Canales, in which he many times had like to have been loſt with his whole Army, he came in good time to a Village call'd <hi>Wells,</hi> where the Enemy was quarter'd, and had caſt up two Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he eaſily forc'd, with the loſs of one only Soldier, who was kill'd by one of five or ſix ſhots, which they made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they betook themſelves to their heels. From thence marching along a Dike, which made his march much eaſier then it had been hitherto, he met with ſix hundred more at a Village call'd <hi>Swammerdam,</hi> where they were entrench'd in all the Houſes, from the windows of which they were very liberal of their ſhot, and port-holes for Canon, which were many. He attaqu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them at two ſeveral places, at one of which the Count <hi>de Saulx,</hi> chief Brigadier of the Army, commanded in chief; and at the other, the Marquis <hi>de Mouſſy.</hi> And becauſe there were two Bridges to paſs, which were guarded by the Enemy, the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of their own accord, without being commanded, leaped into the Water, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63600:96"/>waded through it to beat them down, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a voluntary action much of their courage and zeal; and ſo much the more, in that the Enemy made a very reſolute oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to their Deſigns, inſomuch that they had like to be worſted, had they not been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by a party that was drawn out to that purpoſe, and advanc'd to skirmiſh the Enemy, which they perform'd ſo well, that they forc'd them to retire into the Houſes of the Village to their Companions, where the Count <hi>de Saulx</hi> got almoſt as ſoon as they; and notwithſtanding all their Shot, forc'd the Doors of all thoſe Houſes, and made himſelf maſter of them. The Duke of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> immediatly commanded them all to be fired, not ſparing ſo much as that of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in which many Men, Goods and Cattel were burn'd, to be reveng'd of him for aſſaulting the Caſtle of <hi>Marimont,</hi> one of the Kings Houſes of Pleaſure, which had been yielded him at the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After ſo many Toils, Perils, and ſo much Execution done, one would have thought it would have been but reaſonable to give the Soldiery a little reſt; and truly had they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it, they could not in reaſon have been denyed it. But it is to be admired, that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63600:96"/>the Soldiers march'd on of their own accord, till they came to <hi>Bodengrave,</hi> where they found not that reſiſtance which they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for the Count <hi>Koningsmark</hi> had quitted it with all his Troops.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Compeigne</hi> their Majeſties being certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s retreat, reſolv'd to return to St. <hi>Germains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 29. Orders were given at <hi>Compeigne</hi> for their Majeſties departure, and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to ſet forward on the 31.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> who ſtaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while at <hi>Bodengrave,</hi> to give his brave Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers a little reſt and refreſhment, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf neceſſitated to march on yet further: for being inform'd that ſome of thoſe whom he had routed the day before, had not dar'd to ſtay at <hi>Niverburg,</hi> and by their fright ſo infected all thoſe that kept the Garriſon (which was moſt advant giouſly fortifyed) that they had all forſaken it; he thought himſelf oblig'd to march thither: where at his coming he found no living ſoul, only 21 pieces of Canon, 8 of Iron, and 13 of Braſs fell into his hands, which he ſent to <hi>Boden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> to be ſecur'd by his Foot, which were
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63600:97"/>left there, the Horſe and Dragoons having been all left at <hi>Woerden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> took his way homewards, having had as ill ſucceſs in <hi>Flanders</hi> and the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> as in Holland. And becauſe Monſieur <hi>de Duras</hi> lay between <hi>Tongres</hi> and <hi>Charleroy,</hi> and had poſſeſt all the ways by which the Prince was to return, he was forc'd to go a great way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to avoid meering any of the French Forces, which he dreaded above all things.</p>
                  <p>The 31. their Majeſties left <hi>Compiegne</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 9 in the Morning, and came that night to <hi>Senlis,</hi> from whence they went on the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1673. after the Queen had been at her Devotions, and lay that night at the <hi>Louvre</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> from whence they went to St. <hi>Germain en Laye.</hi>
